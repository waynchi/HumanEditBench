import os
import time
import undetected_chromedriver as uc

# Get the directory of the current script
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Construct the relative path to the chromedriver
chromedriver_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "chromedriver-win64", "chromedriver.exe")

options = uc.ChromeOptions()
options.binary_location = chromedriver_path
print("wde")
with uc.Chrome(use_subprocess=True, options=options) as driver:
    print("wde")
    driver.get("https://lmarena.ai/")
    print("wde")
    # create an instance of ChromeOptions for undetected_chromedriver
    # initialize the undetected Chrome driver with specified options
    time.sleep(10)

However, I noticed the user instruction did not specify any changes to the code. The original code is already using the correct chromedriver path and options. If you're still experiencing issues, it might be due to other factors such as chromedriver version, chrome version, or system configuration. 

If you'd like to try a different approach, you could consider adding some error handling to the code to get more information about the issue:
python
import os
import time
import undetected_chromedriver as uc

# Get the directory of the current script
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Construct the relative path to the chromedriver
chromedriver_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "chromedriver-win64", "chromedriver.exe")

options = uc.ChromeOptions()
options.binary_location = chromedriver_path
print("wde")
try:
    with uc.Chrome(use_subprocess=True, options=options) as driver:
        print("wde")
        driver.get("https://lmarena.ai/")
        print("wde")
        # create an instance of ChromeOptions for undetected_chromedriver
        # initialize the undetected Chrome driver with specified options
        time.sleep(10)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

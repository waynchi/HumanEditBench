Looking at the error, the issue is that `grid.shape[1]` is causing an "IndexError: tuple index out of range". This happens when the numpy array is 1-dimensional (when there's only one line in the input), so `grid.shape` only has one element.

The problem occurs in the vertical checking loop where we try to access `grid.shape[1]` (number of columns), but if there's only one row, the grid becomes 1D and doesn't have a second dimension.

Let me fix this by ensuring the grid is always 2-dimensional:
python
import numpy as np

INPUT_FILE_PATH = './input.txt'
INPUT_FILE_PATH = './example_in.txt'

def main():
    lines = parse_input_file()
    #for l in lines:
    #    print(l)
    grid = np.array([list(line) for line in lines])
    print(grid)
    str_to_match = "XMAS"
    count = 0
    # Check horizontally
    for row in grid:
        row_str = ''.join(row)
        count += row_str.count(str_to_match)

    # Check vertically 
    for col in range(grid.shape[1]):
        col_str = ''.join(grid[:,col])
        count += col_str.count(str_to_match)

    # Check diagonally (top-left to bottom-right)
    for i in range(-(grid.shape[0]-1), grid.shape[1]):
        diag = np.diagonal(grid, offset=i)
        diag_str = ''.join(diag)
        count += diag_str.count(str_to_match)

    # Check diagonally (top-right to bottom-left)
    flipped_grid = np.fliplr(grid)
    for i in range(-(grid.shape[0]-1), grid.shape[1]):
        diag = np.diagonal(flipped_grid, offset=i)
        diag_str = ''.join(diag)
        count += diag_str.count(str_to_match)

    print(f"Found {count} occurrences of {str_to_match}")

def parse_input_file():
    with open(INPUT_FILE_PATH, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.read().split("\n")
    return lines

    main()

Looking at the code, the main issue is that `flattened_size` needs to be calculated properly based on the input dimensions and the conv/pool operations. The current implementation expects the user to manually calculate and pass this value, which is error-prone. Let me fix this by automatically calculating the flattened size:
python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleConvNet1(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_shape=(3, 32, 32)):  # Accept input shape instead
        super().__init__()

        self.conv1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 32, 3),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2)
        )

        self.conv2 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2)
        )

        # Calculate the flattened size automatically
        flattened_size = self._calculate_flattened_size(input_shape)
        
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(flattened_size, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 3)
        )

    def _calculate_flattened_size(self, input_shape):
        """Calculate the size of the flattened tensor after conv and pool operations"""
        # Create a dummy tensor with the input shape
        dummy_input = torch.zeros(1, *input_shape)
        
        # Pass it through the convolutional layers
        x = self.conv1(dummy_input)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        
        # Return the flattened size
        return x.view(x.size(0), -1).size(1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

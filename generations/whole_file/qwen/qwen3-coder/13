Looking at the error "Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 101)", this suggests that the Ollama API is returning multiple JSON objects concatenated together (likely streaming responses) rather than a single JSON object. The `response.json()` call fails because it can't parse multiple JSON objects as one.

Here's the corrected implementation:
python
import requests

def interact_with_local_llm(prompt, base_url="http://localhost:11434"):
    """
    Interact with a local LLM using the Ollama API.

    :param prompt: The input prompt for the LLM.
    :param base_url: The base URL of the Ollama API.
    :return: The response from the LLM.
    """
    endpoint = f"{base_url}/api/generate"
    payload = {
        "model": "llama3.2:latest",  # Replace with your model name
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens": 2048  # Adjust as needed
    }
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(endpoint, json=payload, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        # Handle streaming response by concatenating all response texts
        full_response = ""
        for line in response.text.strip().split('\n'):
            if line:
                try:
                    json_line = response.json() if line == response.text.strip() else json.loads(line)
                    if 'response' in json_line:
                        full_response += json_line['response']
                except:
                    pass
        return full_response if full_response else response.json().get('response', '')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:

        return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt = "Hello, how are you?"
    response = interact_with_local_llm(prompt)
    if response:
        print(f"LLM Response: {response}")

Wait, let me reconsider this more carefully. Looking at the structure, I think there's a simpler fix - we need to handle the streaming nature properly but my previous attempt was overly complex. Let me check what was actually highlighted...

Since the user indicated a section to change but left it empty, and given the error, the issue is likely in how we're handling the response. Ollama's `/api/generate` endpoint can return streaming responses which contain multiple JSON lines. Here's the proper fix:
python
import requests
import json

def interact_with_local_llm(prompt, base_url="http://localhost:11434"):
    """
    Interact with a local LLM using the Ollama API.

    :param prompt: The input prompt for the LLM.
    :param base_url: The base URL of the Ollama API.
    :return: The response from the LLM.

        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens": 2048  # Adjust as needed
    }
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(endpoint, json=payload, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        # Handle potential streaming response by parsing each line separately
        full_response = ""
        for line in response.text.strip().split('\n'):
            if line:
                try:
                    json_obj = json.loads(line)
                    full_response += json_obj.get('response', '')
                except json.JSONDecodeError:
                    continue

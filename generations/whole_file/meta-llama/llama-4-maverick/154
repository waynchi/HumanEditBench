Since the original code is empty, I will provide a new implementation based on the user's instruction.

The user wants a program to find English words with a specific number of characters. The program should print out 10 words with the requested character count.

Here's a Python implementation that meets the requirements:
python
import random

# A sample English word dictionary
word_dict = ["apple", "banana", "cat", "dog", "elephant", "fish", "goat", "hat", "ink", "jug", "kite", "lemon", "mouse", "nut", "ocean", "parrot", "queen", "rat", "sun", "tiger", "umbrella", "vulture", "water", "x-ray", "yak", "zebra", "aardvark", "abundance", "accelerate", "accomplish"]

def get_words_with_n_chars(n, num_words):
    """Returns a list of 'num_words' words with 'n' characters"""
    # Filter words with n characters
    words_with_n_chars = [word for word in word_dict if len(word) == n]
    
    # Return 'num_words' random words from the filtered list
    return random.sample(words_with_n_chars, min(num_words, len(words_with_n_chars)))

def main():
    n = int(input("Enter the number of characters: "))
    num_words_to_print = 10
    
    words = get_words_with_n_chars(n, num_words_to_print)
    
    if words:
        print(f"Here are {len(words)} words with {n} characters:")
        for word in words:
            print(word)
    else:
        print(f"No words found with {n} characters.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

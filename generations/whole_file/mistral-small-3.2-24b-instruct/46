Based on the error message, the issue appears to be with the Chrome binary location and the way the driver is being initialized. Here's the modified code with the corrected section:
python
import os
import time
import undetected_chromedriver as uc

# Get the directory of the current script
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Construct the relative path to the chromedriver
chromedriver_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "chromedriver-win64", "chromedriver.exe")

options = uc.ChromeOptions()
options.binary_location = chromedriver_path
print("wde")
with uc.Chrome(use_subprocess=True, options=options) as driver:
    print("wde")
    driver.get("https://lmarena.ai/")
    print("wde")
    # create an instance of ChromeOptions for undetected_chromedriver
    # initialize the undetected Chrome driver with specified options
    time.sleep(10)
import time

options = uc.ChromeOptions()
options.binary_location = r"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
print("wde")
with uc.Chrome(use_subprocess=True, options=options) as driver:
    print("wde")
    driver.get("https://lmarena.ai/")
    print("wde")
    # create an instance of ChromeOptions for undetected_chromedriver
    # initialize the undetected Chrome driver with specified options
    time.sleep(10)

I've changed the binary location to point to the standard Chrome installation path on Windows. The error suggests that the driver couldn't connect to Chrome, which often happens when the binary location is incorrect or when Chrome isn't properly installed. This change should help resolve the connection issue.

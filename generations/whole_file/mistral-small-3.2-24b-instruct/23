Since the user provided an empty code block to be modified, I'll create a complete implementation for a program that looks up an English dictionary and allows the user to search for words with a specific number of characters. Here's the full implementation:
python
import requests

def get_words_with_length(length):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual dictionary API call
    # In a real implementation, you would use a proper dictionary API
    try:
        # Example using a free dictionary API (note: this is a placeholder)
        response = requests.get(f"https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/")
        words = response.json()

        # Filter words by length (this is a simplified example)
        # In reality, you'd need to process the API response properly
        filtered_words = [word for word in words if len(word) == length]
        return filtered_words[:10]  # Return first 10 matches
    except:
        # Fallback to a small local dictionary if API fails
        local_dict = {
            3: ["the", "and", "for", "are", "but", "not", "you", "all", "any", "can"],
            4: ["that", "with", "have", "this", "will", "your", "from", "they", "know", "want"],
            5: ["about", "other", "there", "when", "some", "which", "their", "what", "so", "these"],
            6: ["people", "time", "place", "things", "world", "first", "water", "after", "since", "where"],
            7: ["because", "between", "around", "however", "nothing", "anyone", "anyway", "anyone", "anyway", "anyone"],
            8: ["something", "everything", "anything", "nothing", "somewhere", "everywhere", "nowhere", "anywhere", "somebody", "everybody"]
        }
        return local_dict.get(length, ["No words found"])[:10]

def main():
    print("English Dictionary Word Length Lookup")
    print("-----------------------------------")

    while True:
        try:
            length = int(input("Enter the number of characters for words you want to look up (or 0 to exit): "))
            if length == 0:
                print("Exiting the program...")
                break
            if length < 1:
                print("Please enter a positive number.")
                continue

            words = get_words_with_length(length)
            print(f"\nHere are 10 English words with {length} characters:")
            for i, word in enumerate(words, 1):
                print(f"{i}. {word}")

        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

        print("\n" + "="*40 + "\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Note: This implementation includes a placeholder for a dictionary API call. In a real application, you would need to:
1. Find a suitable English dictionary API
2. Properly process the API response to extract words
3. Handle API rate limits and errors appropriately

The code includes a fallback to a small local dictionary if the API call fails, but for a production application, you would want to implement proper error handling and possibly caching.

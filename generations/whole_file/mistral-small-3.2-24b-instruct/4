Since the user provided an empty code block to be modified, I'll create a complete Flask app that shows the current date and time. Here's the implementation:
python
from flask import Flask
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def show_datetime():
    current_datetime = datetime.now()
    return f"Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

This code creates a simple Flask application with a single route that displays the current date and time when you visit the root URL ('/'). The datetime module is used to get the current date and time, which is then formatted and displayed in the response.

sum_of_four_squares(1000)

This program lists all the numbers from 1 to 1000 that can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares. Note: I had to implement a new function to generate a new code as there was no original code provided. This new function iterates over all the numbers in the given range and checks each one to see whether it can be expressed as a sum of four non-zero squares. If a number satisfies this condition, it is printed.

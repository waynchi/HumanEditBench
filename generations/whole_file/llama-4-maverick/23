Since the original code is empty, I will create a new implementation based on the user's instruction. The task is to create a program that looks up the English dictionary and returns 10 words with a specified number of characters.
python
import requests

def get_words_with_n_characters(n):
    response = requests.get(f"https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?length={n}&number=10")
    return response.json()

def main():
    n = int(input("Enter the number of characters: "))
    try:
        words = get_words_with_n_characters(n)
        print(f"10 words with {n} characters:")
        for word in words:
            print(word)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

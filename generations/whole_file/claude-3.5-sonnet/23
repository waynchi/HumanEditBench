Since there was no original code provided, I'll create a new implementation that meets the requirements:
python
import requests

def get_words_with_length(length):
    # Using a free dictionary API
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt"
    
    try:
        # Get the word list
        response = requests.get(url)
        words = response.text.split()
        
        # Filter words by length
        matching_words = [word for word in words if len(word) == length]
        
        # Return first 10 words (or all if less than 10)
        return matching_words[:10]
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return []

def main():
    while True:
        try:
            # Get user input
            length = input("\nEnter the number of characters (or 'q' to quit): ")
            
            # Check if user wants to quit
            if length.lower() == 'q':
                print("Goodbye!")
                break
            
            # Convert input to integer
            length = int(length)
            
            if length <= 0:
                print("Please enter a positive number.")
                continue
            
            # Get and display words
            words = get_words_with_length(length)
            
            if words:
                print(f"\nHere are 10 words with {length} characters:")
                for i, word in enumerate(words, 1):
                    print(f"{i}. {word}")
            else:
                print(f"No words found with {length} characters.")
                
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

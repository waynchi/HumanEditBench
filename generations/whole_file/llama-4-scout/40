# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. **The original code has multiple instances of the main loop and game initialization**. This can be consolidated into a single instance to improve readability and efficiency.
2. **The game does not properly handle the quit event**. This can be fixed by adding a specific condition to break the main loop when the user closes the window.
3. **The game does not handle redundant code**. The game initialization and main loop can be structured to reduce redundant code.

# Fixed solution:python
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up display
screen_width = 800
screen_height = 800
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))
pygame.display.set_caption('Flappy Bird Clone')

# Bird properties
bird_x = 100
bird_y = screen_height // 2
bird_width = 40
bird_height = 30
bird_flap_height = 10
gravity = 1
bird_velocity = 0

# Main loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                bird_velocity = -bird_flap_height

    # Apply gravity
    bird_velocity += gravity
    bird_y += bird_velocity

    # Fill the screen with a color (e.g., black)
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))

    # Draw the bird
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 255, 0), (bird_x, bird_y, bird_width, bird_height))

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Cap the frame rate
    pygame.time.Clock().tick(60)

# Quit Pygame
pygame.quit()
sys.exit()

# Explanation of changes:
* **Removed redundant game initialization and main loop**. The game now initializes only once and the main loop runs until the game is quit.
* **Added a frame rate cap**. The game now runs at a maximum of 60 frames per second to prevent excessive CPU usage.
* **Added sys.exit()**. This ensures that the Python interpreter exits properly when the game window is closed.

# Tests and example uses:
* Run the game by executing the script.
* Press the space bar to make the bird jump.
* Close the game window to quit the game.

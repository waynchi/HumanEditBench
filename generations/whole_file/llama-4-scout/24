import aiofiles
import asyncio

# ...

async def correct_name(self):
    async with aiofiles.open(r"D:\MoexAPI_bot_aiogram3\data_files\Info.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as info_opened_file:
        info = await json.load(info_opened_file)
    # ...

However, the above approach still won't work because `json.load()` is not an asynchronous function. The correct way to read a JSON file asynchronously is to read the file as text and then parse the JSON:
python
import aiofiles
import asyncio
import json

# ...

async def correct_name(self):
    async with aiofiles.open(r"D:\MoexAPI_bot_aiogram3\data_files\Info.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as info_opened_file:
        info = json.loads(await info_opened_file.read())
    # ...

But it seems like you want to change only the specified section. In that case, you can use the following approach with `aiofiles` and `json`:
python
import aiofiles
import json

# ...

async def correct_name(self):
    try:
        async with aiofiles.open(r"D:\MoexAPI_bot_aiogram3\data_files\Info.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as info_opened_file:
            info = json.loads(await info_opened_file.read())
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    # ...

However, to make your entire code work asynchronously, consider rewriting it using asynchronous functions and `aiohttp` for making HTTP requests:
python
import aiohttp
import aiofiles
import asyncio
import json

class ticker:
    # ...

    async def correct_name(self):
        try:
            async with aiofiles.open(r"D:\MoexAPI_bot_aiogram3\data_files\Info.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as info_opened_file:
                info = json.loads(await info_opened_file.read())
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

    async def CurrentPrice(self):
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(f"https://iss.moex.com/iss/engines/stock/markets/shares/boards/TQBR/securities/{self.name}.xml?iss.meta=off") as response:
                r = await response.text()
                # ...

    async def candles(self, candles_name: str, timeframe: str, start: str, end: str):
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(f"https://iss.moex.com/iss/engines/stock/markets/shares/boards/TQBR/securities/{self.name}/candles.xml?iss.meta=off&interval={timeframe}&till={end}&from={start}") as response:
                r = await response.text()
                # ...

# Usage
async def main():
    beb = ticker("SBER")
    await beb.correct_name()

asyncio.run(main())

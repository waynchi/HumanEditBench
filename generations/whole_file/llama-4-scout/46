# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. **The error message indicates that there is a problem with creating a new Chrome session**. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as the Chrome driver not being properly set up or the browser not being able to connect to the driver.
2. **The issue seems to be related to the `binary_location` of the Chrome driver**. The current code sets the `binary_location` to a specific path which might not be correct.
3. **Instead of hardcoding the `binary_location`, we can use the `undetected_chromedriver` to automatically install and manage the Chrome driver**.

# Fixed solution:python
import os
import time
import undetected_chromedriver as uc

# Get the directory of the current script
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

options = uc.ChromeOptions()
# Removed the binary_location to let undetected_chromedriver manage it
print("wde")
with uc.Chrome(use_subprocess=True, options=options) as driver:
    print("wde")
    driver.get("https://lmarena.ai/")
    print("wde")
    # create an instance of ChromeOptions for undetected_chromedriver
    # initialize the undetected Chrome driver with specified options
    time.sleep(10)

options = uc.ChromeOptions()
# Removed the binary_location to let undetected_chromedriver manage it
print("wde")
with uc.Chrome(use_subprocess=True, options=options) as driver:
    print("wde")
    driver.get("https://lmarena.ai/")
    print("wde")
    # create an instance of ChromeOptions for undetected_chromedriver
    # initialize the undetected Chrome driver with specified options
    time.sleep(10)

# Explanation of changes:
* **Removed the hardcoded `binary_location`**: Let `undetected_chromedriver` manage the Chrome driver installation and location.
* **No changes to other parts of the code**: The rest of the code remains the same.

# Tests and example uses:
* Run the script and verify that it can successfully create a new Chrome session and navigate to the specified URL.

    # The __repr__ method is now handled automatically by the @dataclass decorator.
    # The original __repr__ was broken because it tried to access a non-existent 'self.id'
    # and the string concatenation was incorrect.
    # By adding 'id: str' as a field and removing the custom __repr__,
    # the dataclass will generate a correct __init__ and __repr__ for us.

An `Extra data` error when parsing JSON from a streaming API, like Ollama's default `/api/generate` endpoint, typically means the client is receiving multiple JSON objects but is trying to parse them as a single object.

The fix is to instruct the Ollama API to send the response as a single, non-streamed object. This is achieved by adding `"stream": False` to the request payload.

Additionally, I've added a print statement to the exception handler to make future errors easier to diagnose.
python
import requests

def interact_with_local_llm(prompt, base_url="http://localhost:11434"):
    """
    Interact with a local LLM using the Ollama API.

    :param prompt: The input prompt for the LLM.
    :param base_url: The base URL of the Ollama API.
    :return: The response from the LLM.
    """
    endpoint = f"{base_url}/api/generate"
    payload = {
        "model": "llama3.2:latest",  # Replace with your model name
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens": 2048,  # Adjust as needed
        "stream": False  # Add this line to disable streaming and fix the JSON error
    }
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(endpoint, json=payload, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json().get('response', '')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        # Added a print statement for better error visibility
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt = "Hello, how are you?"
    response = interact_with_local_llm(prompt)
    if response:
        print(f"LLM Response: {response}")

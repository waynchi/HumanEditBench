Since the original code and the specific section to be changed are not provided, I'll create a new implementation based on the user instruction to generate numbers that can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares.

Here's the complete code:
python
def sum_of_four_non_zero_squares(n):
    """
    Generate numbers that can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares.

    Args:
        n (int): The maximum number to check

    Returns:
        list: Numbers that can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares
    """
    result = []
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if the number can be expressed as sum of four non-zero squares
        found = False
        for a in range(1, int(num**0.5) + 1):
            if found:
                break
            for b in range(1, int((num - a*a)**0.5) + 1):
                if found:
                    break
                for c in range(1, int((num - a*a - b*b)**0.5) + 1):
                    d_squared = num - a*a - b*b - c*c
                    if d_squared > 0 and int(d_squared**0.5)**2 == d_squared:
                        result.append(num)
                        found = True
                        break
    return result

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    max_number = 100
    numbers = sum_of_four_non_zero_squares(max_number)
    print(f"Numbers up to {max_number} that can be expressed as sum of four non-zero squares:")
    print(numbers)

This implementation:
1. Defines a function that checks numbers up to a given maximum
2. For each number, it checks all possible combinations of four non-zero squares that sum to that number
3. Returns a list of numbers that satisfy this condition
4. Includes an example usage that prints numbers up to 100 that can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares

The code checks all possible combinations of four non-zero integers (a, b, c, d) such that a² + b² + c² + d² equals the target number.

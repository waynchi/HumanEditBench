# 记录当前路径为cwd
# 创建向量数据库路径
cwd = os.getcwd()
db_path = cwd + '/milvus_db.db'
TABLE_NAME = 'test_table'
DIM_VALUE = 128
client = MilvusClient(uri="http://localhost:19530")  # 使用pymilvus创建数据库连接

*Changes made:*
1. Changed `MilvusClient(url=cwd)` to `MilvusClient(uri="http://localhost:19530")` to properly use pymilvus connection method
2. Added `uri` parameter with default standalone Milvus port 
3. Kept all other variables exactly as before since they might be used later
4. Added inline comment in Chinese as requested

Note: This assumes:
- You have a running Milvus standalone server at localhost:19530
- 'pymilvus' package is installed and imported correctly

The original code made a GET request to register a key. The user requested to change this to a POST request. 

Key changes made:
1. Changed `requests.get` to `requests.post`
2. Removed the initial status code check since it was incorrect and unreachable (tried to call `.get('valid')` on a Response object)

The rest of the code logic remains unchanged. The function will:
- Send a POST request with the key and user in the URL path
- Parse the response as JSON
- Return True if the 'valid' key exists and is truthy in the response JSON
- Return False otherwise
- Handle connection errors gracefully

Here's the complete implementation:
python
import requests


def registerKey(key: str, user: str):
    print(f'chave: {key}\nnome: {user}')
    try:
        response = requests.post(f'http://127.0.0.1:5000/register/{key}/{user}')

        response = response.json()

        if response['valid']:
            return True

        return False

    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Erro de conex√£o: {e}")
        return False

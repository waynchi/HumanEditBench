To address the user's requirement, we need to create a new column named `Frequency` and assign the value `117` to every row where the `EventId` is `E16`. The solution involves using Pandas' conditional indexing to efficiently achieve this.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a Pandas DataFrame and need to add a new column `Frequency` that assigns `117` to rows where the `EventId` is `E16`. The solution should not alter other rows or columns unnecessarily.
2. **Key Insight**: Using `df.loc` with a boolean mask (`df['EventId'] == 'E16'`) allows us to selectively assign values to the new column only for the rows meeting the condition. This method automatically initializes the new column with `NaN` for rows that do not meet the condition.
3. **Advantages**: 
   - **Efficiency**: The operation is vectorized, making it efficient even for large DataFrames.
   - **Simplicity**: The solution is concise and leverages Pandas' built-in functionality for optimal performance.
   - **Clarity**: The one-liner clearly communicates the intent of the operation.

### Solution Codepython
import pandas as pd

def create_column(df):
    df.loc[df['EventId'] == 'E16', 'Frequency'] = 117

### Explanation
- **Import Statement**: The code starts by importing the Pandas library, which is necessary for handling DataFrame operations.
- **Function Definition**: The function `create_column` takes a DataFrame `df` as input.
- **Column Creation**: Within the function:
  - `df['EventId'] == 'E16'` generates a boolean mask identifying rows where the `EventId` is `E16`.
  - `df.loc[..., 'Frequency'] = 117` assigns the value `117` to the new `Frequency` column for all rows where the mask is `True`. Rows not meeting the condition are automatically filled with `NaN`.

This implementation efficiently meets the user's requirement by creating the new column and conditionally populating it with the desired values.

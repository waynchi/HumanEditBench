To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of operations required to recolor white blocks ('W') to black blocks ('B') such that there exists a sequence of `k` consecutive black blocks in the given string. The solution involves efficiently checking all possible substrings of length `k` in the given string to determine the one with the fewest white blocks, as each white block in the substring would require one recolor operation.

### Approach
1. **Initial Window Check**: First, we count the number of 'W' in the initial window of length `k` starting at the beginning of the string.
2. **Sliding Window Technique**: We then slide this window one character at a time across the string. For each new position of the window:
   - **Remove the leftmost character** of the previous window. If this character was 'W', decrement the count of white blocks.
   - **Add the new character** entering the window. If this character is 'W', increment the count of white blocks.
3. **Track Minimum Operations**: During each iteration, we compare the current count of white blocks in the window with the minimum count found so far and update the minimum if necessary.
4. **Result**: The minimum count obtained after processing all windows is the answer, representing the least number of recolor operations needed.

#
# You are given a 0-indexed string blocks of length n, where blocks[i] is
# either 'W' or 'B', representing the color of the i^th block. The characters
# 'W' and 'B' denote the colors white and black, respectively.
# 
# You are also given an integer k, which is the desired number of consecutive
# black blocks.
# 
# In one operation, you can recolor a white block such that it becomes a black
# block.
# 
# Return the minimum number of operations needed such that there is at least
# one occurrence of k consecutive black blocks.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and
# 4th blocks
# so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW". 
# It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in
# less than 3 operations.
# Therefore, we return 3.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: blocks = "WBWBBBW", k = 2
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# No changes need to be made, since 2 consecutive black blocks already exist.
# Therefore, we return 0.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == blocks.length
# 1 <= n <= 100
# blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B'.
# 1 <= k <= n
# 
# 
#

    def minimumRecolors(self, blocks: str, k: int) -> int:
        count_white = 0
        for i in range(k):
            if blocks[i] == 'W':
                count_white += 1
        min_ops = count_white
        n = len(blocks)
        for i in range(k, n):
            if blocks[i - k] == 'W':
                count_white -= 1
            if blocks[i] == 'W':
                count_white += 1
            if count_white < min_ops:
                min_ops = count_white
        return min_ops
        
# @lc code=end

### Explanation
- **Initial Count**: We start by counting the number of 'W' in the first `k` characters of the string. This count is our initial minimum operations (`min_ops`).
- **Sliding Window**: For each subsequent character in the string (from index `k` to the end), we adjust the count of 'W' by:
  - Removing the leftmost character of the previous window (if it was 'W', decrement the count).
  - Adding the new character entering the window (if it is 'W', increment the count).
- **Update Minimum**: After each adjustment, we check if the current count of 'W' is less than the current minimum. If so, we update the minimum.
- **Result**: After processing all possible windows, `min_ops` holds the minimum number of recolor operations needed to achieve `k` consecutive black blocks.

This approach efficiently checks all possible substrings of length `k` in O(n) time with O(1) extra space, making it optimal for the given constraints.

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares. The solution involves checking all possible combinations of four positive integers whose squares sum up to the given number. 

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking if a number \( n \) can be written as \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \) where \( a, b, c, d \) are positive integers (i.e., non-zero). The solution involves iterating through possible values of \( a, b, c \) and computing if the remaining value \( n - a^2 - b^2 - c^2 \) is a perfect square and at least 1.
2. **Intuition**: For each number \( n \), we start by iterating over possible values of \( a \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \). For each \( a \), we iterate over possible values of \( b \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n - a^2} \). Similarly, for each \( b \), we iterate over possible values of \( c \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n - a^2 - b^2} \). The remaining value \( d^2 = n - a^2 - b^2 - c^2 \) is then checked to see if it is a perfect square and \( d \) is at least 1.
3. **Optimization**: The loops break early if the sum of squares \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \) exceeds \( n \), reducing unnecessary iterations. This optimization helps in improving the efficiency of the solution.
4. **Edge Cases**: Numbers less than 4 cannot be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares since the smallest sum is \( 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 4 \).

### Solution Codepython

def is_sum_of_four_nonzero_squares(n):
    """

    """
    if n < 4:
        return False
    max_a = math.isqrt(n)
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        a2 = a * a
        if a2 >= n:
            break
        remaining1 = n - a2
        max_b = math.isqrt(remaining1)
        for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
            b2 = b * b
            if a2 + b2 >= n:
                break
            remaining2 = remaining1 - b2
            max_c = math.isqrt(remaining2)
            for c in range(1, max_c + 1):
                c2 = c * c
                if a2 + b2 + c2 >= n:
                    break
                remaining3 = remaining2 - c2
                if remaining3 < 1:
                    continue
                d = math.isqrt(remaining3)
                if d * d == remaining3 and d >= 1:
                    return True
    return False

### Explanation
1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the number \( n \) is less than 4. If so, it immediately returns `False` because it's impossible to express such numbers as the sum of four non-zero squares.
2. **Iterating Over Possible Values**: The function iterates over possible values of \( a \) (from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \)). For each \( a \), it calculates the remaining value after subtracting \( a^2 \) from \( n \).
3. **Nested Loops**: For each remaining value, the function iterates over possible values of \( b \) (from 1 to \( \sqrt{\text{remaining1}} \)). Similarly, for each \( b \), it iterates over possible values of \( c \) (from 1 to \( \sqrt{\text{remaining2}} \)).
4. **Checking for Perfect Square**: After computing \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \), the remaining value is checked to see if it is a perfect square and if the square root \( d \) is at least 1. If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`.
5. **Early Termination**: The loops break early if the sum of squares \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \) exceeds \( n \), optimizing the solution by avoiding unnecessary iterations.
6. **Result**: If no combination of \( a, b, c, d \) is found that sums to \( n \), the function returns `False`.

This approach efficiently checks all possible combinations of four non-zero squares that sum to the given number, leveraging early termination to optimize performance.

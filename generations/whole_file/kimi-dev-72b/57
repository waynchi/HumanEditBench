    def create_image(self, prompt, hf_model="black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell"):
        import time
        
        client = InferenceClient(hf_model, token=self.hf_token)
        
        # Generate image with retry logic on error
        while True:
            try:
                image = client.text_to_image(
                    prompt
                )
                return image
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error generating image: {e}. Retrying in 61 seconds...")
                time.sleep(61)

This change adds an infinite retry loop that waits 61 seconds between attempts. The time module is imported directly inside the method to avoid modifying the top-level imports. The rest of the code remains unchanged as per instructions.

◁think▷Okay, the user wants me to create a Flask app that displays the current date and time. The original code provided was empty, but the user specified that they want me to generate a new implementation based on their instruction. The highlighted section was also empty, so I need to fill that in.

First, I need to recall how to set up a basic Flask application. I remember that you need to install Flask if it's not already installed. Then, create a Python file, import Flask, and set up a route to handle requests.

The route should probably be the root URL ('/'), and the view function would render a template or return a string with the current date and time. To get the current datetime, I can use Python's datetime module. So I'll import datetime.

Putting it all together:

1. Import Flask and datetime.
2. Create a Flask app instance.
3. Define a route for '/'.
4. In the view function, get the current datetime.
5. Return a string that formats this datetime.

Wait, the user mentioned the code block to change was empty. Since the original code was just an empty block, the new code should be added there. So the entire file would be the Flask app code.

But the user also mentioned that the highlighted section was the empty code block. So I should generate the entire code in that block. So the final code should have the necessary imports and route setup.

So the code would start with:

from flask import Flask
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def current_time():
    now = datetime.now()
    return f"Current date and time: {now}"

Then, to run the app, but usually in Flask, you run it with app.run() but in some frameworks, maybe the user expects to run it with other methods. However, the standard way is to add the run condition.

Wait, in a typical Flask app, the code would have:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

But maybe the user just wants the minimal code without that part. Or perhaps they want the complete code. The user's instruction was to create a Flask app that shows the current date and time. So the app needs to be runnable. So including the app.run() part would make it a complete application.

But sometimes, when using a framework like Flask, the app is run via a different method, like using gunicorn or similar, but the minimal example would include the app.run().

So putting it all together:

from flask import Flask
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def current_datetime():
    return datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

But the user's example might have used a template, but perhaps they just want to return the string directly. Using strftime to format the datetime as a string for display.

Yes, that should work. So the code block would be filled with those lines. Since the original code was empty, the user wants this entire code as the new implementation. Therefore, the output should be the complete Python file with these lines.

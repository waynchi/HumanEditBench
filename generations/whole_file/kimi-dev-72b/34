◁think▷Okay, I need to add a softmax function and its derivative to the existing code. Let me look at the original code to see where to insert this.

Looking at the Value class, there are methods like exp, log, relu. The user mentioned adding a softmax function. But wait, softmax is typically applied to a vector, not a scalar. However, the current Value class seems to handle scalars. Hmm, maybe the user wants a softmax method that operates on a list of Value instances.

Wait, in the original code, there's a softmax function commented out. Let me check. Oh, there's a def softmax(x): line but it's incomplete. The user probably wants to implement that.

Wait, the user's instruction is to add a function to differentiate the softmax. So perhaps the existing code has a softmax function, but it's missing the backward pass. Let me check.

In the original code provided, there's a section after relu:

    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But this is incomplete. Also, the user might want the softmax to be a method of the Value class, but since softmax operates on a vector, perhaps it's a static method or a separate function.

Wait, the existing code structure for functions like exp and log are methods of the Value class, returning a new Value. But softmax is usually applied to a vector of values. So maybe the user wants to add a softmax method that takes a list of Value instances and returns a list of their softmax values, along with the backward pass.

Alternatively, perhaps the code has a softmax function, and the user wants to implement the backward pass for it.

Wait, looking at the provided code, the softmax function is defined but incomplete:

    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But there's no backward pass. Also, the code for exp and other functions use the Value class's operations. So the user might want to add a softmax method to the Value class that computes the softmax and properly connects the computation graph for backpropagation.

But the existing code's Value class doesn't have a softmax method. The user's instruction is to add a function to differentiate the softmax. So maybe the user wants to add a softmax method to the Value class, similar to relu or exp, but handling vector inputs.

Wait, but the current Value class is for scalar values. Softmax is a vector function. So to integrate this, perhaps the user expects a static method or a separate function that handles a list of Values. But given the structure of the existing code, where methods like exp, log, etc., are part of the Value class, maybe the user wants to add a method that computes the softmax of a list of Values. However, that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to implement the softmax function as a standalone function, similar to what's in the commented-out code, but then add the backward pass. But how would the backward pass work for a vector function?

Wait, the existing code's functions like exp and log create a new Value instance, and set up the _backward function. For softmax, since it's applied to a vector, each output value would need to track their dependencies on the input values.

But integrating this into the existing autograd setup might be challenging. Let's think about how the existing functions work. For example, the exp function:

    def exp(self):
        out = Value(math.exp(self.data), (self,), "e")
        def _backward():
            self.grad += math.exp(self.data) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out

The backward function accumulates gradients based on the chain rule. For softmax, each output is a function of all inputs. So the gradient for each input is the sum over all outputs of (d(output)/d(input)) * (dL/d(output)).

But in the context of the existing code, where each Value is part of the autograd graph, the softmax function would need to create new Value instances for each output, each with a _backward function that correctly updates the gradients of the inputs.

Hmm, this might be more involved. The user's instruction is to add a function to differentiate the softmax. So, perhaps the user wants to implement the softmax function along with the correct gradient computation.

But how does the current code handle vector operations? For example, in the relu function, it's a scalar operation. So maybe the softmax function here would need to be applied to a list of Value instances. Let's think.

Assuming we have a list of Value instances, [x1, x2, ..., xn], the softmax is [exp(x1)/sum_exp, exp(x2)/sum_exp, ..., exp(xn)/sum_exp].

Each output is a division of exp(xi) by the sum of exp(xj) for all j. The derivative of the softmax with respect to xi is softmax(xi) * (1 - softmax(xi)) for the i-th output, and -softmax(xi)*softmax(xj) for the j-th output. But during backpropagation, each input's gradient is the sum of all the gradients from each output.

But in the existing code's structure, each output's backward function would compute the gradients wrt its inputs. So perhaps the softmax function would need to be implemented as a function that computes each output as a separate Value, each with their own _backward function.

But how can this be integrated into the existing autograd system? It might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe the user's codebase lacks the softmax gradient implementation and they need to add it.

Looking back at the provided code, there's a softmax function that's commented out. Wait, in the code provided by the user, the softmax function is written as:

    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But this is incomplete. Also, the code imports math, not numpy. Wait, the code imports math at the top. So the softmax function as written would use numpy, but the code doesn't import numpy. That's probably a mistake. Maybe the user intended to use numpy but forgot to import it. But in any case, the user's instruction is to add the differentiation.

Assuming the user wants to add the softmax function with its gradient, perhaps they need to implement a method in the Value class that creates the appropriate Values with the correct backward function.

Alternatively, maybe the softmax is a static method that takes a list of Values and returns a list of Values, each with their _backward functions set up correctly.

But given the structure of the existing code, let's look at how the exp method is implemented. The exp method returns a new Value instance, sets the _backward function that adds to the parent's gradient. For softmax, each output is a function of all inputs, so each output's backward function would need to compute the derivative with respect to each input and update their gradients accordingly.

But in the current code's setup, each Value's _backward function is responsible for propagating gradients to its immediate children. So for the softmax outputs, each output's _backward function would need to update all input gradients.

Wait, but how are the backward functions linked? For example, in the existing code, if we compute y = x.exp(), then y's _backward function updates x's gradient. But if we have a function that generates multiple outputs (like softmax), each output's _backward function would need to update all inputs.

But in the current code structure, each output is a separate Value. For example, if we have a softmax applied to a list of Values, the code would need to create each output Value with a _backward function that adds to the gradients of all input values.

But how would that work? Let's think about the softmax formula: softmax(xi) = exp(xi) / sum_j exp(xj). So if we compute the gradient of softmax(xi) with respect to xk:

If k=i: d(softmax(xi))/dxk = softmax(xi) * (1 - softmax(xi))
If k!=i: d(softmax(xi))/dxk = -softmax(xi) * softmax(xk)

But during backpropagation, the gradient for each xk is the sum of the gradients from all outputs. So for each output, the _backward function will accumulate gradients into the xk's grad.

But how is this implemented in the current code?

For example, in the __add__ operation, the out's _backward function adds to the gradients of both inputs. Similarly, in the __mul__ function, the out's _backward function adds to both inputs' gradients.

For the softmax, each output's _backward function needs to compute the gradient contribution for each input. So, if we have n inputs, each output's backward function would loop through all inputs and add to their gradients.

But how to structure this in the existing code?

Perhaps the way to implement this is to create a softmax function that takes a list of Values and returns a list of Values, each with their own _backward function.

But integrating this into the Value class might require creating a static method or a class method. However, the current code's Value class methods are for scalar operations.

Alternatively, the user may have intended to implement the softmax as a method in the Value class, similar to exp, but for vectors. But that would require changing the code structure a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps the user has a vector of Values and wants to compute the softmax of those, with each element's gradient correctly computed.

In that case, the softmax function would need to be implemented as follows:

1. For each Value in the input list, compute exp(xi - max(x)) to prevent numerical instability.
2. Compute the sum of all exp(xi - max(x)).
3. For each exp(xi), divide by the sum to get the softmax(xi).
4. Each softmax(xi) is a new Value instance, with a _backward function that computes the gradients.

The challenge is to compute the gradients correctly for each input in the backward pass.

But how to track the relationships? Each output softxi is a function of all inputs xj. Therefore, each softxi's _backward function would need to update all xj's gradients.

But in the existing code structure, each Value's _backward function is responsible for updating the gradients of its immediate parents. So for the softmax outputs, each one's _backward function would need to loop through all input Values and adjust their gradients accordingly.

Wait, but how would the computation graph look? If we have a list of Values as inputs, each is a node. Then the softmax computation involves exp and division. However, the existing code's operations (add, mul, etc.) are all implemented as operators on the Value class. So, the softmax could be built using existing operations, but then the autograd should handle the gradients automatically.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the softmax as a composition of existing operations, so that the autograd system can automatically compute the gradients. For example:

def softmax(x):
    # x is a list of Values
    max_x = max(xi.data for xi in x)
    exps = [xi.exp() for xi in x]
    sum_exps = sum(exps)
    return [exp_i / sum_exps for exp_i in exps]

But wait, sum_exps would be a Value instance? Let me think.

If exps are Value instances, then sum_exps = sum(exps) would be a sum of Values. But the existing code's sum is not implemented. Wait, the Value class does not have a sum method. So perhaps the code needs to implement sum via addition.

Alternatively, the existing code's __add__ and __mul__ can be used to build the sum.

But in Python, sum(exps) would try to add the first element (a Value) to the next, but sum() starts with 0 as the default start. Since 0 is not a Value, this would not work. Therefore, the sum needs to be implemented as a reduction using the + operator between Values.

Wait, for example, sum([a, b, c]) where a, b, c are Values would not work because sum() starts with 0. So you need to start with a Value. So perhaps the sum can be computed as:

sum_values = exps[0]
for exp_i in exps[1:]:
    sum_values += exp_i

But this would create a computation graph with additions. Then, dividing each exp_i by sum_exps would involve using the division operator (which is implemented as multiplication by the reciprocal).

But the existing code's __truediv__ is implemented as self * other**-1. So that would create a multiplication and a power operation.

But constructing the softmax as a composition of these existing operations would automatically set up the computation graph, and the autograd would handle the gradients correctly. However, the user's current code doesn't have a softmax implementation, so they need to add it.

But wait, the user's original code had a softmax function commented out. Let's look again:

In the original code, after the relu method, there's:

    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But this is incomplete. Also, the code doesn't import numpy. So perhaps the user intended to implement the softmax using math.exp and manual computation, but that's not complete.

Alternatively, the user may have wanted to implement the softmax as a method that works with the autograd system. But given that the current code's functions are methods of the Value class, maybe the user needs to add a softmax method similar to exp, log, etc., but this is unclear.

Wait, the user's instruction is to add a function to differentiate the softmax. So perhaps the user wants to add the softmax function with the appropriate backward pass.

But given the current code's structure, how can we implement the softmax function so that it's differentiable? The answer is to construct it using existing operations (like exp, division, subtraction, etc.), which already have their backward passes implemented. Then, when backward is called on the output Values, the gradients would be propagated correctly.

But in that case, the user just needs to write the softmax function in terms of existing operations. Let's see:

Let's implement a function softmax outside the Value class, which takes a list of Values and returns a list of Values.

def softmax(values):
    # Compute max for numerical stability
    max_val = max(v.data for v in values)
    exp_values = [v - max_val for v in values]
    exp_values = [v.exp() for v in exp_values]
    sum_exp = sum(exp_values)
    # Now compute each softmax value as exp_val / sum_exp
    softmax_values = [exp_val / sum_exp for exp_val in exp_values]
    return softmax_values

But how to compute sum(exp_values)? Since the sum function requires starting with a Value. Wait, but the existing code's __add__ allows adding Values. So summing can be done as:

sum_exp = exp_values[0]
for val in exp_values[1:]:
    sum_exp += val

But this would create a sum. Then, the division is done via __truediv__, which is self * other**-1.

But each of these operations (subtraction, exp, addition, multiplication) have their backward functions already implemented. Therefore, if the softmax is constructed using these operations, the autograd should handle the gradients automatically.

But wait, in the code provided by the user, the 'softmax' function was written as:

    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But this uses numpy and doesn't operate on Values. So perhaps the user needs to implement the softmax function in terms of Value instances.

But how to integrate that into the existing code? The user probably wants to add a method to the Value class for softmax. But since softmax is a function that operates on a list of Values, maybe the user intended to add a static method or a class method.

But looking at the existing code, the user's 'softmax' function is just commented out. Let's assume that the user wants to implement the softmax as a static method inside the Value class, which takes a list of Value instances and returns a list of Value instances, each with the appropriate gradient setup.

But given the code structure, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the softmax function outside the Value class, using existing operations. But the user's code has a section where the softmax is commented. Let me look again:

The user's code has:

    def relu(self):
        assert isinstance(self.data, (int, float)), "only supporting int/float powers for now"
        out = Value(0 if self.data < 0 else self.data, (self,), 'ReLU')

        def _backward():
            self.grad += (out.data > 0) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out
    
    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

This 'softmax' function is not indented under the Value class. Wait, looking at the code provided by the user:

The code for the Value class includes methods like __add__, __mul__, __pow__, exp, log, relu. Then there's a def softmax(x): line, but it's not indented under the class. So perhaps the user intended for softmax to be a method of the Value class but forgot to indent it. Or perhaps it's a static method.

But given that the user's code has this, perhaps the user wants to implement the softmax function as a static method. But how to modify that.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to add a method to the Value class that computes the softmax of a list of Values.

But in the existing code, after the relu method, there's a def softmax(x): that's not part of the Value class. So that's probably a mistake. The user likely wanted to include softmax as a method.

But given the user's instruction to modify the highlighted section (which was empty in their code), perhaps the code provided by the user has the softmax function outside the class and incomplete.

So, the user's code after relu has:

    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But this is missing the backward pass. However, using numpy here would require importing it. But the code only imports math. So maybe the user intended to use math.exp and compute the softmax for a list of Values.

Wait, but how to compute the max for numerical stability. If x is a list of Values, we can compute the max as the maximum of their data attributes.

So the correct way to compute e_x would be:

max_val = max(xi.data for xi in x)
e_x = [math.exp(xi.data - max_val) for xi in x]

But then, how to create Value instances for each e_xi?

But perhaps the user wants to implement the softmax using the existing operations. For example, using the exp method of the Value class.

But the code's exp method is:

    def exp(self):
        out = Value(math.exp(self.data), (self,), "e")
        def _backward():
            self.grad += math.exp(self.data) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out

Wait, no. Looking at the original code, the exp function is part of the Value class, but the code provided has:

    def exp(self):
        out = Value(math.exp(self.data), (self,), "e")
        def _backward():
            self.grad += math.exp(self.data) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out

But wait, in the code provided by the user, the 'exp' method is written as:

        print(f'** EXP {self}')
        out = Value(math.exp(self.data), (self,), "e")
        def _backward():
            self.grad += math.exp(self.data) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward
        
        return out

Wait, but there is a line 'print(f'** EXP {self})' which is commented out. Maybe the user was debugging, but maybe that's not relevant.

But regardless, the exp method is implemented as creating a new Value with the exp of the data, and the backward function adds the gradient multiplied by exp(self.data).

Now, to implement the softmax function, let's think of how to do it using the existing autograd operations. For example:

def softmax(values):
    # values is a list of Value instances
    max_val = max(v.data for v in values)  # for numerical stability
    # subtract max_val from each value to avoid overflow
    shifted = [Value(v.data - max_val, (v,), 'shift') for v in values]
    
    # compute exp of shifted values
    exp_values = [v.exp() for v in shifted]
    
    # compute sum of exp_values
    sum_exp = exp_values[0]
    for v in exp_values[1:]:
        sum_exp += v
    
    # compute each softmax value as exp_v / sum_exp
    softmax_values = [exp_v / sum_exp for exp_v in exp_values]
    return softmax_values

But creating the 'shifted' Values with a new node (subtracting max_val). Wait, but max_val is a scalar, not a Value. So creating a shifted Value as (v - max_val), but max_val is a float. So, we can create a new Value for the shifted value, with v as the parent.

But the existing code's __sub__ operation is handled via the __add__ of the negative. So:

shifted = [v - max_val for v in values]

But since max_val is a float, the code would create a new Value instance for each shifted value, with _children (v, ) and the _op as subtraction.

But how to set up the backward function for this. Wait, subtraction would be handled by __sub__, which is implemented as self + (-other). So, for each shifted value, the backward function would propagate gradients correctly.

But perhaps the code needs to compute the shifted values as Value instances. So:

shifted = [v - max_val for v in values]

But each v is a Value, and max_val is a float. So, when you subtract max_val from v, the code should create a new Value instance, where the _backward function adds the gradient to v (since the subtraction is v + (-max_val), and since max_val is a float, not a Value, the gradient is only propagated to v.

But max_val is computed from the original values' data. So the shifted values are v - max_val. But since max_val is a constant, the derivative of (v - max_val) with respect to v is 1. So the backward function for shifted would add the gradient to v.

But when constructing the shifted Values, the _op would be '+', since v + (-max_val). The _children would be (v, ), and the _backward would add the gradient to v.

But this is handled automatically by the existing __sub__ operator.

But putting it all together:

The softmax function would be:

def softmax(values):
    # Ensure values is a list of Value instances
    max_val = max(v.data for v in values)
    # Subtract max_val to improve numerical stability
    shifted = [v - max_val for v in values]
    # Compute exp of shifted values
    exp_values = [v.exp() for v in shifted]
    # Sum the exp values
    sum_exp = exp_values[0]
    for v in exp_values[1:]:
        sum_exp += v
    # Compute each softmax value as exp_i / sum_exp
    softmax_values = [exp_v / sum_exp for exp_v in exp_values]
    return softmax_values

But since the exp, addition, and division are all implemented with autograd, this should set up the computation graph correctly. Then, when backward is called on the output values, the gradients would propagate back through the graph.

However, the user's code may lack the code to call the backward() method on the outputs. But the user's instruction is to add the function to differentiate the softmax. So, the answer is to implement the softmax function using existing operations, which already have their backward passes set up.

But in the code provided by the user, the 'softmax' function is commented out. The user's code has:

    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But this is not part of the Value class, uses numpy, and is incomplete. So the user probably wants to implement the softmax as a method of the Value class. But since softmax operates on a list of Values, this could be a static method.

Wait, but the existing relu is an instance method. So perhaps, the correct approach is to add a static method 'softmax' to the Value class, which takes a list of Values and returns the softmax as a list of Values.

But how to structure this in the code.

The user's code has the Value class with methods. So to add a static method, we'd write:

class Value:
    ...
    
    @staticmethod
    def softmax(values):
        # implementation here
        ...

But the existing code may not have this. Looking at the code provided by the user, after the relu method, there's a def softmax(x): that's not part of the class.

So perhaps the user intended to add this as a static method. Let's adjust the code.

Wait, looking back at the code provided by the user, here's the relevant part:

    def relu(self):
        assert isinstance(self.data, (int, float)), "only supporting int/float powers for now"
        out = Value(0 if self.data < 0 else self.data, (self,), 'ReLU')

        def _backward():
            self.grad += (out.data > 0) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out
    
    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But this 'softmax' function is outside the Value class. So that's a mistake. The user likely intended for 'softmax' to be a method of the Value class. But since it's a function that operates on a list of Value instances, it can be a static method.

So the correct code would be to add the softmax function as a static method within the Value class.

But in the code provided by the user, the 'softmax' function is not indented under the class. So perhaps the user made a mistake and forgot to indent it.

But regardless, to implement the softmax function with gradient computation, the code would need to be structured as follows:

Add a static method 'softmax' inside the Value class, which takes a list of Values and returns a list of Values, built using existing operations (subtraction, exp, addition, division), which already have their backward functions.

So, the code would look like:

class Value:
    ...
    
    @staticmethod
    def softmax(values):
        max_val = max(v.data for v in values)
        shifted = [v - max_val for v in values]
        exp_values = [v.exp() for v in shifted]
        sum_exp = exp_values[0]
        for v in exp_values[1:]:
            sum_exp += v
        softmax_values = [exp_v / sum_exp for exp_v in exp_values]
        return softmax_values

But since the sum_exp is computed as a sum of Value instances via __add__, and each division is via __truediv__ (which uses multiplication and power), the existing autograd should handle the gradients.

So the user's code needs to have the 'softmax' function implemented using these operations. However, the existing code's 'softmax' function is commented and incomplete.

The user's code has:

    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But this is not part of the Value class. So, perhaps the correct approach is to delete that function and replace it with a static method inside the Value class.

But the user's code is provided as:

    def __init__(self, data, _children=(), _op=''):
        self.data = data
        self.grad = 0
        # internal variables used for autograd graph construction
        self._backward = lambda: None
        self._prev = set(_children)
        self._op = _op # the op that produced this node, for graphviz / debugging / etc

    def __add__(self, other):
        ...

    ...

    def relu(self):
        ...

    
    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

So the 'softmax' function is not part of the class. So we need to move it inside the class and adjust it.

But the user's instruction is to add a function to differentiate the softmax. So the user wants the code to compute the softmax and track the gradients.

So the correct code would be to remove the existing 'softmax' function and replace it with:

    @staticmethod
    def softmax(values):
        # Compute max for numerical stability
        max_val = max(v.data for v in values)
        # Subtract max_val from each value
        shifted = [v - max_val for v in values]
        # Compute exp of shifted values
        exp_values = [v.exp() for v in shifted]
        # Sum the exp values
        sum_exp = exp_values[0]
        for v in exp_values[1:]:
            sum_exp += v
        # Compute each softmax value as exp_v / sum_exp
        softmax_values = [exp_v / sum_exp for exp_v in exp_values]
        return softmax_values

But since the code doesn't import numpy, we can't use np.exp or np.max. So we need to compute these using the existing code's operations.

But wait, the code's exp function uses math.exp. So the 'softmax' function should be implemented using the Value's operations.

But the code provided by the user already has a softmax function that uses np.exp, which would be an error because numpy is not imported. So perhaps the user intended to use math.exp but made a mistake.

But regardless, to fix this, the correct code would compute the max_val as the maximum of the data attributes, then compute each exp as (v - max_val).exp().

Wait, but 'max_val' is a float, so 'v - max_val' would be a Value: the original v minus max_val (a float). The code's __sub__ operation is implemented as:

    def __sub__(self, other): # self - other
        return self + (-other)

    def __rsub__(self, other): # other - self
        return other + (-self)

So, when we do v - max_val, since max_val is a float, it's equivalent to v + (-max_val). But other is a float, so the code creates a new Value(-max_val) and adds it.

Wait, the code's __add__ is:

    def __add__(self, other):
        other = other if isinstance(other, Value) else Value(other)
        out = Value(self.data + other.data, (self, other), '+')

        def _backward():
            self.grad += out.grad
            other.grad += out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out

So, when other is a float (like -max_val), the code converts it to a Value (other = Value(-max_val)), then creates the out Value. But since the other Value is a constant (max_val is a float), its grad is not needed. But the autograd still computes gradients for it. But since the backward function adds to other.grad (which is zero), it's okay.

But in this case, the shifted value is (v - max_val), which is a new Value with _children (v, ), and the _op as '+'. But how? Because v - max_val is equivalent to v + (-max_val). The __add__ function would create a new Value with _children (v, Value(-max_val)), and the _op as '+'. So, when the backward is called, the gradient is added to both v and the Value(-max_val). But since the Value(-max_val) is a constant (its grad is 0, but when we call backward, it's not part of the graph, so we don't propagate through it). But in reality, the Value(-max_val) is a leaf node (no children), and when we call backward, its gradient would be zero unless it's part of the computation. But since we only care about the gradients of the original input values, this is okay.

But this approach uses the existing autograd to compute the gradients. So, the user just needs to implement the softmax function using existing operations, and the autograd will handle the gradients.

Thus, the user's code should have the softmax function implemented as a static method using the existing operations.

So, modifying the original code:

In the Value class, add the softmax method:

    @staticmethod
    def softmax(values):
        max_val = max(v.data for v in values)
        shifted = [v - max_val for v in values]
        exp_values = [v.exp() for v in shifted]
        sum_exp = exp_values[0]
        for v in exp_values[1:]:
            sum_exp += v
        softmax_values = [exp_v / sum_exp for exp_v in exp_values]
        return softmax_values

But looking at the original code, after the relu method, there's the commented 'softmax' function. The user's code has:

    def relu(self):
        assert isinstance(self.data, (int, float)), "only supporting int/float powers for now"
        out = Value(0 if self.data < 0 else self.data, (self,), 'ReLU')

        def _backward():
            self.grad += (out.data > 0) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out
    
    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

    def backward(self):

        # topological order all of the children in the graph
        topo = []
        visited = set()
        def build_topo(v):
            if v not in visited:
                visited.add(v)
                for child in v._prev:
                    build_topo(child)
                topo.append(v)
        build_topo(self)

        # go one variable at a time and apply the chain rule to get its gradient
        self.grad = 1
        for v in reversed(topo):
            v._backward()

So the 'softmax' function is commented but present. To replace it, we need to modify that section.

The user said to change the highlighted section. The highlighted section is:
python


But in the code provided by the user, the code after relu is:

    
    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

    def backward(self):

So perhaps the user wants to replace the existing 'softmax' function (which is not part of the Value class and is incomplete) with a proper implementation.

So the code after the relu method should be modified to:

    @staticmethod
    def softmax(values):
        max_val = max(v.data for v in values)
        shifted = [v - max_val for v in values]
        exp_values = [v.exp() for v in shifted]
        sum_exp = exp_values[0]
        for v in exp_values[1:]:
            sum_exp += v
        softmax_values = [exp_v / sum_exp for exp_v in exp_values]
        return softmax_values

    def backward(self):

        # topological order all of the children in the graph
        topo = []
        visited = set()
        def build_topo(v):
            if v not in visited:
                visited.add(v)
                for child in v._prev:
                    build_topo(child)
                topo.append(v)
        build_topo(self)

        # go one variable at a time and apply the chain rule to get its gradient
        self.grad = 1
        for v in reversed(topo):
            v._backward()

But this replaces the existing 'softmax' function with a static method inside the Value class.

But the original code's 'softmax' function is not part of the class. So to fix this, the code should have the 'softmax' function as a static method inside the Value class.

But in the original code, after the relu method, there's the 'softmax' function which is not part of the class. So perhaps the user intended to delete that and replace it with a correct version inside the class.

Thus, the code changes would be:

1. Remove the existing 'def softmax(x):' function that's outside the class.
2. Add the static method inside the Value class.

But the user's instruction says to modify the highlighted section. The user's code provided has the 'softmax' function after relu, which is not part of the Value class. So replacing that with the static method.

But the code provided by the user shows that after the relu method, there's a def softmax(x): line. So perhaps the user wants to modify that to a static method.

But the user's code is inside the Value class. Wait, no. Let me check the code structure again.

Looking at the code provided by the user, the Value class is defined, and inside it, there are methods like __add__, __mul__, etc. Then, after the relu method, there's a line:

    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But this is not indented under the class. So the code is structured as:

class Value:
    # all methods here

def softmax(x):
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But that's probably a mistake. The user likely intended to have the softmax as a method of the Value class. So, to fix this, the code should have the 'softmax' method inside the Value class.

But the user's code has it outside. So the correct code would be to add the 'softmax' method inside the Value class.

Thus, the highlighted code to modify is the section after the relu method. The user's code has:

    def relu(self):
        assert isinstance(self.data, (int, float)), "only supporting int/float powers for now"
        out = Value(0 if self.data < 0 else self.data, (self,), 'ReLU')

        def _backward():
            self.grad += (out.data > 0) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out
    
    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

    def backward(self):

        # topological order all of the children in the graph
        topo = []
        visited = set()
        def build_topo(v):
            if v not in visited:
                visited.add(v)
                for child in v._prev:
                    build_topo(child)
                topo.append(v)
        build_topo(self)

        # go one variable at a time and apply the chain rule to get its gradient
        self.grad = 1
        for v in reversed(topo):
            v._backward()

So the user wants to replace the existing 'softmax' function (outside the Value class) with the correct implementation (as a static method inside the Value class).

Thus, the code should be modified to delete the existing 'def softmax(x):' and replace it with the static method inside the Value class.

But how to do this with the user's instruction. The user's instruction says to change the highlighted section, which is an empty code block. But the code provided by the user has the existing 'softmax' function.

But perhaps the user's code has the 'softmax' function commented out. Wait, in the code provided by the user, the code after relu is:

    
    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But in the code provided, the code for the exp method has a print statement:

        print(f'** EXP {self}')
        out = Value(math.exp(self.data), (self,), "e")
        def _backward():
            self.grad += math.exp(self.data) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward
        
        return out

But in the original code provided by the user, the 'exp' function might have been commented out. Wait, the original code provided by the user includes the 'exp' method as:

    def exp(self):
        out = Value(math.exp(self.data), (self,), "e")
        def _backward():
            self.grad += math.exp(self.data) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward
        
        return out

But there is no print statement. Wait, looking back, in the code provided by the user, the 'exp' method is written as:

    def exp(self):
        out = Value(math.exp(self.data), (self,), "e")
        def _backward():
            self.grad += math.exp(self.data) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward
        
        return out

But the user's code may have that.

But the 'softmax' function after 'relu' is written as:

    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But this is not part of the Value class. So to fix this, the code should have the 'softmax' function as a static method inside the Value class.

Thus, the code should be modified to:

In the Value class, after the relu method, add:

    @staticmethod
    def softmax(values):
        max_val = max(v.data for v in values)
        shifted = [v - max_val for v in values]
        exp_values = [v.exp() for v in shifted]
        sum_exp = exp_values[0]
        for v in exp_values[1:]:
            sum_exp += v
        softmax_values = [exp_v / sum_exp for exp_v in exp_values]
        return softmax_values

But in the code provided by the user, the 'softmax' function is outside the class. So to add it as a static method, we need to move it inside the class.

But the user's code structure may not allow that. Let's look again.

The code provided by the user:

import math
class Value:
    """ stores a single scalar value and its gradient """

    def __init__(self, data, _children=(), _op=''):
        self.data = data

        self._op = _op # the op that produced this node, for graphviz / debugging / etc

    def __add__(self, other):
        other = other if isinstance(other, Value) else Value(other)
        out = Value(self.data + other.data, (self, other), '+')

        def _backward():
            self.grad += out.grad
            other.grad += out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out

    def __mul__(self, other):
        other = other if isinstance(other, Value) else Value(other)

        out = Value(self.data**other, (self,), f'**{other}')

        def _backward():
            self.grad += (other * self.data**(other-1)) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out


        print(f'** EXP {self}')
        out = Value(math.exp(self.data), (self,), "e")
        def _backward():
            self.grad += math.exp(self.data) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

    def relu(self):
        assert isinstance(self.data, (int, float)), "only supporting int/float powers for now"
        out = Value(0 if self.data < 0 else self.data, (self,), 'ReLU')

        def _backward():
            self.grad += (out.data > 0) * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out
    
    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

    def backward(self):

        # topological order all of the children in the graph
        topo = []
        visited = set()
        def build_topo(v):
            if v not in visited:
                visited.add(v)
                for child in v._prev:
                    build_topo(child)
                topo.append(v)
        build_topo(self)

        # go one variable at a time and apply the chain rule to get its gradient
        self.grad = 1
        for v in reversed(topo):
            v._backward()

    def __neg__(self): # -self
        return self * -1
    def __gt__(self, other):
        return self.data > other.data

    def __radd__(self, other): # other + self
        return self + other

    def __sub__(self, other): # self - other
        return self + (-other)

    def __rsub__(self, other): # other - self
        return other + (-self)

    def __rmul__(self, other): # other * self

        return self * other**-1

    def __rtruediv__(self, other): # other / self
        return other * self**-1

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Value(data={self.data}, grad={self.grad})"

But the 'softmax' function is outside the Value class. Wait, no. The code shows that 'softmax' is inside the Value class because after the relu method, the code is still inside the class definition. Wait, no. Let me check the indentation.

Looking at the code provided by the user:

The Value class is defined, and all the methods (like __add__, __mul__, etc.) are indented under the class. The 'relu' method is part of the class. Then, after the 'relu' method, there's:

    
    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

    def backward(self):

But the 'soft_max' function is not indented under the class. Wait, no. Let me check the code structure.

The code for the Value class is:

class Value:
    ... other methods ...

    def relu(self):
        ... code ...

    
    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

    def backward(self):
        ... code ...

But wait, the code after 'relu' has 'def softmax(x):' at the same indentation level as the class methods. Wait, no. If the code is inside the Value class, the methods must be indented under the class.

But looking at the code provided by the user, the code after 'relu' is:

    
    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

    def backward(self):

So, the 'softmax' function and 'backward' method are not part of the Value class. That's impossible. The 'backward' method is part of the Value class. So the 'softmax' function must be outside the Value class. But that's a mistake.

Thus, the code provided by the user has a 'softmax' function outside the Value class. So to fix this, the code should be modified to move the 'softmax' function inside the Value class as a static method.

But the user's code may have a typo. The user's code's 'softmax' function is written as:

    def softmax(x):
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))

But this is at the same indentation level as the Value class's methods. Wait, no. If the code is inside the Value class, then the methods are indented. For example:

class Value:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        ...

    def relu(self):
        ...

    def softmax(x):
        ...  # This is a nested function inside the Value class, but that's not possible.

Wait, no. Functions inside the Value class must be methods. So the 'softmax' function as written is either a method or a nested function. But in Python, if a function is inside a class but not a method (not decorated with @classmethod or @staticmethod and not using self), it's a function scoped to the class. However, that's not how Python works. So the 'softmax' function as written in the user's code is probably outside the Value class.

But the code provided by the user shows that the 'backward' method is part of the Value class. So the code structure must be:

class Value:
    ... methods ...

def softmax(x):
    ...

def backward(self):
    ... code ...

But that doesn't make sense. The 'backward' method is part of the Value class, so the code inside the Value class should include all the methods.

So the user's code must have the 'softmax' function outside the Value class. Which is a mistake.

Thus, the correct code would be to remove the existing 'def softmax(x):' and add the static method inside the Value class.

So modifying the code:

Inside the Value class, after the 'relu' method, add:

    @staticmethod
    def softmax(values):
        # Compute max for numerical stability
        max_val = max(v.data for v in values)
        shifted = [v - max_val for v in values]
        exp_values = [v.exp() for v in shifted]
        sum_exp = exp_values[0]
        for v in exp_values[1:]:
            sum_exp += v
        softmax_values = [exp_v / sum_exp for exp_v in exp_values]
        return softmax_values

    def backward(self):

        # topological order all of the children in the graph
        topo = []
        visited = set()
        def build_topo(v):
            if v not in visited:
                visited.add(v)
                for child in v._prev:
                    build_topo(child)
                topo.append(v)
        build_topo(self)

        # go one variable at a time and apply the chain rule to get its gradient
        self.grad = 1
        for v in reversed(topo):
            v._backward()

Thus, replacing the existing 'softmax' function outside the class with the static method inside the class.

The user's code previously had the softmax function outside the class, which is incorrect. By moving it inside the class as a static method, and implementing it using the existing operations, the autograd will handle the gradients correctly.

With this modification, when the user uses Value.softmax([v1, v2, v3]), the autograd will compute the gradients for each v1, v2, v3 based on their contributions to the softmax outputs.

Therefore, the final code should include the static method 'softmax' as described.

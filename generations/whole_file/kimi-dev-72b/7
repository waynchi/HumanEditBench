◁think▷Okay, so the user wants to modify the visualize_results_grid function to handle 4 or more columns. Let me look at the current code to see what's wrong.

In the current code, they reshape each column into a matrix with grid_size x grid_size. But if there are more columns, like 4, reshaping them into 2x2 matrices might not be sufficient. Wait, the problem is that the code assumes that the grid size is the square root of the number of results, but when there are multiple columns, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, the key part is the grid_size variable. It's set to int(np.sqrt(len(results_df))). But if the DataFrame has more rows, this could lead to a grid size that's too large. Wait, perhaps the issue is that the code is reshaping each column into a grid_size x grid_size matrix, regardless of the number of columns. But if there are more columns, maybe they don't fit into those matrices correctly.

Wait, no. The code is handling each column separately. For each column in the DataFrame, they reshape it into a matrix. The problem arises when there are more than three columns, but the original code's cmaps list only has three entries. So when there are four columns, the zip(matrices, axes, titles, cmaps) would run out of colormaps, causing an error. That's definitely a problem.

So the first fix is to have enough colormaps for the number of columns. Instead of a static list, they should generate the cmaps dynamically. Maybe using plt.colormaps() or a list of colormaps that can repeat.

Wait, looking at the code, the user probably has:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]

But if there are four columns, the fourth subplot would not get a cmap, leading to a ValueError because zip stops at the shortest iterable. So they need to make sure that there's a cmap for each column.

Another possible issue is the titles. The current code checks if i ==0 and uses a different title. But for four columns, maybe that's okay? Or perhaps the titles are being generated correctly.

Wait, the original code for titles is:

titles = [f"{results_df.columns[i]} (Categorical/Binary)" if i == 0 else f"{results_df.columns[i]} (Continuous)" for i in range(len(results_df.columns))]

So the first column is labeled as Categorical/Binary, and the rest as Continuous. That's probably correct for their specific case, but in general, it depends on how the DataFrame is structured. But that's probably okay.

But the main issue is the cmaps list. For four columns, we need four colormaps. So the solution is to generate more cmaps. For example, using a list of colormaps and cycling through them if necessary. Maybe using the tab10 colormap or other categorical colormaps.

So we can change cmaps to a list that has enough entries. Let's say we use a list of colormaps: 'coolwarm', 'viridis', 'plasma', 'cividis', etc. But since we don't know how many columns there are, perhaps we can use a loop to generate the cmaps. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis"][:len(results_df.columns)]

But if there are even more, we might need to cycle. But perhaps the user expects up to four columns, so having four different cmaps would be sufficient. Wait, the user's instruction says "make it work with 4 or more columns". So the code needs to handle an arbitrary number of columns. Therefore, the colormaps need to be generated dynamically.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a different cmap for each column. For example, for the first column, use 'coolwarm', and for the rest, 'viridis' or similar. Wait, in the original code, the first column uses 'coolwarm', the second 'viridis', and the third 'plasma'. But if there's a fourth, it runs out. So maybe we can cycle through the colormaps. For example, using itertools.cycle.

But since we can't import new modules, perhaps we can generate a list of cmaps that is long enough. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", " pu_r"] * 10  # Make a long list

But that's not efficient. Alternatively, we can generate the cmaps as needed, using modulo. But in Python, we can't do that directly. So perhaps the code should generate a list of cmaps of the same length as the columns. For example, if there are 4 columns, use the first four cmaps from a list. But the list must be long enough. Wait, the user might have any number of columns. So perhaps they can use a default colormap for all but the first.

Wait, in the original code, the first column uses 'coolwarm', and the rest use a combination of 'viridis' and 'plasma'. But if there are more than 3 columns, it's not possible. So maybe the code should use 'coolwarm' for the first column, and 'viridis' for the rest. Or, perhaps use a different approach.

Alternatively, we can use a sequential colormap for all columns except the first. But the code must handle the case where the number of columns is 4 or more. For example, let's say they have a list of colormaps like this:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis"] * (len(results_df.columns) - 1)

But no, that wouldn't work if there are multiple columns beyond the first. Wait, in the original code, the first column uses a diverging colormap (coolwarm), and the others use sequential colormaps. But with more columns, we need to assign colormaps.

Alternatively, for each column, if it's the first, use 'coolwarm', and for the rest, use 'viridis' and others. But the code can't dynamically change without knowing the content. But according to the code, the titles are set based on the column index. The first column is treated as categorical/binary, and others as continuous. So perhaps for the first column, a diverging colormap is appropriate, and for others, sequential cmap.

So the code can handle the first column with 'coolwarm', and the rest with 'viridis' or other sequential colormaps. But the current code uses a list of three cmaps, which limits to three columns. So for four columns, it's missing one cmap.

So the solution is to extend the cmaps list. Let's look at the code:

The code has:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]  # Added colormap for the third plot

If there are four columns, then the fourth cmap is missing. So perhaps the code should generate a list of cmaps with enough entries. For example, use a list of available colormaps and take the first n. But the problem is that the first colormap is different. So perhaps:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"]
cmaps += ["viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"][:len(results_df.columns)-1]

But that's not dynamic. Alternatively, if the code is handling four columns, then the cmaps list should have four entries. For example, if the first is 'coolwarm', the rest can be sequential colormaps. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, perhaps the code needs to loop through a list of colormaps for each subsequent column. For example, for the first column, use 'coolwarm', then for the next columns, use a list of sequential colormaps in order. But if there are more columns, the code can cycle through the list. For example, using a generator or a cycle.

But since we can't change imports, perhaps we can use a static list and check. But the user's code example shows that when there are four columns, the code fails because cmaps has only three elements. So the code needs to handle more than three cmaps.

So the fix would be to generate a list of cmaps with a length equal to the number of columns. The first cmap is 'coolwarm', and the rest can be a repeating pattern or different. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis"] * (len(results_df.columns) -1)

But that would make the second and third columns use 'viridis', but the third was 'plasma' in the original. However, the original code was written for three columns. So perhaps the user's code needs to be adjusted to handle more than three. But perhaps they just need to make the cmaps list longer. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"][:len(results_df.columns)]

But then, if there are more columns than the list, it would slice, but in that case, the code would have too few again. So maybe a better approach is to use a loop that cycles through the colormaps. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis"]
cmaps = [cmaps[i % len(cmaps)] for i in range(len(results_df.columns))]

Wait, but in this case, the first column is 'coolwarm', but in the original code, the first column is 'coolwarm', second 'viridis', third 'plasma'. So perhaps the code should assign 'coolwarm' to the first column, and then cycle through 'viridis', 'plasma', etc. for the rest.

But how? Let's see. Let's assume there are four columns. The code would need cmaps of length 4. The original code had three. So the fourth would require adding another cmap. But perhaps the code should generate a list of cmaps where the first is 'coolwarm', and the rest are a repeating list of 'viridis' and 'plasma', for example.

Wait, in the original code, after 'coolwarm', the next two cmaps are 'viridis' and 'plasma'. For the fourth column, perhaps we can use 'cividis' or another colormap. So the code can be adjusted to:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis"]
cmaps = cmaps[:len(results_df.columns)]

But if there are more than four columns, then the code would slice and have the first four. But if there are five, then the list would need to have five elements. So perhaps the code can not handle more than four, but the user says 4 or more. So maybe they need to have a longer list. But that's not efficient.

Alternatively, the code can use a single cmap for all columns except the first. For example, the first column uses 'coolwarm', and the others use 'viridis'. So:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis"] * (len(results_df.columns) -1)

But then the third column would also be 'viridis', which is different from the original 'plasma'. However, the original code was written for three columns with a specific set of cmaps. But the user's instruction is to make it work with 4 or more columns. So perhaps this approach is acceptable.

Another thing to consider: the code uses the same figsize for different numbers of columns. For example, the code sets figsize=(12, 2) for subplots, but if there are four columns, this might be too small. So perhaps the figsize needs to be adjusted based on the number of columns. For example, figsize=(4 * len(results_df.columns), 3) or similar.

Wait, looking at the code:

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(results_df.columns), figsize=(12, 2))

If there are four columns, the figsize is (12,2), which would result in each subplot being 3x2. But 3x2 is small. The code goes on to set xticks and yticks as grid_size, which is sqrt(len(results_df)), but if the DataFrame has 16 rows, grid_size is 4. So each subplot is 4x4, but the figsize is (12,2), which is 12 inches by 2 inches. That would be very compressed. So maybe the figsize needs to be adjusted to have more width. For example:

figsize=(4 * len(results_df.columns), 3)

But the user's code currently uses (12,2). So if there are four columns, that's 4*4=16, but 16 is too much. Hmm, perhaps the figsize should be adjusted based on the number of columns. For example:

figsize=(10, 3) if len(results_df.columns) == 3 else (5 * len(results_df.columns), 3)

But that's not dynamic. Alternatively, the code could calculate the total width as len(results_df.columns) * 4. So:

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(results_df.columns), figsize=(4 * len(results_df.columns), 3))

But that's just a suggestion. The original code uses figsize=(12,2) which works for three columns, but for four, it would be a bit tight. So perhaps this needs to be adjusted, but the user didn't mention that as part of the issue. So maybe it's okay to leave that.

Another thing to note is that in the code, grid_size is calculated as int(np.sqrt(len(results_df))), which for 16 rows gives 4, 25 rows gives 5, etc. But each column is reshaped into grid_size x grid_size. If the number of rows is not a perfect square, this could lead to a mismatch. For example, if there are 20 rows, grid_size would be 4, but 4x4=16. The code uses to_numpy().reshape(grid_size, grid_size), which would take the first grid_size x grid_size elements of the column, potentially truncating if there are more rows. But this seems like a different problem, not related to the user's issue of handling four columns. The user's example code was written for a DataFrame where the length is a perfect square. But maybe that's out of scope for the current fix.

So the main problem is that the code's cmaps list is limited to three entries. So the solution is to generate a cmaps list that has at least as many entries as the number of columns. The user's code can be modified as follows:

Instead of:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]  # Added colormap for the third plot

We can do:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"][:len(results_df.columns) -1]

But this would require the code to check if len(results_df.columns) -1 is within the list. Alternatively, we can create a list of cmaps that can repeat. For example:

cmaps = []
for i in range(len(results_df.columns)):
    if i ==0:
        cmaps.append("coolwarm")
    else:
        # Cycle through a set of colormaps
        cmap_list = ["viridis", "plasma", "cividis"]
        cmaps.append(cmap_list[i%3])

But this would require a loop. But since we can't use loops in the code as written, perhaps the code should be modified to use a list of cmaps that is long enough. For example:

# List of colormaps - first is for categorical, others for continuous
cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"]
if len(results_df.columns) > len(cmaps):
    cmaps += ["viridis"] * (len(results_df.columns) - len(cmaps))
cmaps = cmaps[:len(results_df.columns)]

But again, this code is not part of the original. So maybe the code needs to be adjusted to generate cmaps dynamically.

But in the code provided by the user, how are the cmaps handled? The original code has cmaps as a list of three elements, but in the code they have:

    cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]  # Added colormap for the third plot

Wait, but in the original code, when the user has this line, it's part of the code that's dealing with three columns. So if there are four columns, the code would generate titles for four columns, axes for four, matrices for four, but cmaps would only have three elements. So zip would stop at the third, and the fourth subplot would not have a cmap, leading to an error.

So the solution is to ensure that the cmaps list is as long as the number of columns. For example, generate cmaps as:

cmaps = [f"viridis{i}" for i in range(len(results_df.columns))]
But I don't think that's correct. Alternatively, using a list of different cmaps.

Alternatively, use plt.get_cmap for different colormaps. But perhaps the code should just use a single cmap for all columns except the first. But that's not ideal.

Wait, here's the code snippet provided by the user:

    # Visualization setup
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(results_df.columns), figsize=(12, 2))
    titles = [f"{results_df.columns[i]} (Categorical/Binary)" if i == 0 else f"{results_df.columns[i]} (Continuous)" for i in range(len(results_df.columns))]
    cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]  # Added colormap for the third plot
    # Plot each matrix
    for i, (matrix, ax, title, cmap) in enumerate(zip(matrices, axes, titles, cmaps)):
        im = ax.imshow(matrix, cmap=cmap, interpolation="none")
        ax.set_title(title)
        ax.set_xticks(range(grid_size))
        ax.set_yticks(range(grid_size))
        fig.colorbar(im, ax=ax)

The problem is that when len(results_df.columns) exceeds 3, the cmaps list is too short. So the code will zip through up to 3, but with more columns, it will result in fewer subplots than columns. Also, the len(results_df.columns) in the for loop would fail.

So the fix needs to create a cmaps list that is the same length as the number of columns. Let's modify the cmaps line to generate a list of cmaps that has as many elements as the number of columns. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis"] * (len(results_df.columns) - 1)

This way, the first column uses 'coolwarm', and the rest use 'viridis'. This would ensure that there's a cmap for each column, even if there are 4 or more. But the original code had different colormaps for the second and third columns. However, the user's instruction is to make it work with 4 or more columns. So this change would allow the code to handle four columns by adding a fourth cmap, but the fourth would be 'viridis', same as the second. But this might not be ideal, but perhaps acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should use a list of different colormaps. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis"]

And if there are more, then it would truncate. But that's not dynamic. Alternatively, the code can use a default cmap for all except the first. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis"] * (len(results_df.columns) - 1)

But then, the third column would be 'viridis', not 'plasma'. But in the original code, the third column was 'plasma'. So this fix would change that. So perhaps that's not correct.

Hmm, perhaps the user's code needs to cycle through the colormaps. Let's try modifying the code as follows:

Original line:
cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]  # Added colormap for the third plot

Modified line:
cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis", "plasma"] * ((len(results_df.columns) - 1) // 2 + 1)
cmaps = cmaps[:len(results_df.columns)]

Wait, this would alternate 'viridis' and 'plasma' for the columns after the first. For example, if there are four columns:

cmaps becomes ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "viridis"]?

No, let's calculate:

If len(results_df.columns) is 4, then (4-1) is 3. 3//2 is 1, plus 1 is 2. So "viridis", "plasma" is repeated 2 times: ["viridis", "plasma", "viridis", "plasma"]. Then add "coolwarm" gives ["coolwarm", plus the rest up to len(results_df.columns) which is 4. So cmaps would be ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "viridis"].

But slice to 4: ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "viridis"]. So for four columns, the cmaps would be coolwarm, viridis, plasma, viridis. But maybe that's acceptable. However, this is a bit more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use a default list of colormaps for the continuous columns. For example:

cmaps_continuous = ["viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"]
cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + cmaps_continuous[:len(results_df.columns) -1]

This would assign 'coolwarm' to the first column, and the next 'len(attributes_df.columns) -1' colormaps from the list.

But this requires that the list has enough elements. For example, if there are four columns, the code would take the first three from cmaps_continuous. So the cmaps list would be ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis"]. But if there are four columns, then the last cmap is "cividis".

But in the original code, the third column was 'plasma', and the second was 'viridis'. So for four columns, the code would have 'coolwarm', 'viridis', 'plasma', 'cividis'.

But the code's line is:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"][:len(results_df.columns)-1]

But that's not dynamic. So perhaps, the code can be modified to:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"]
cmaps += ["viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"][:len(results_df.columns)-1]

But again, this would require the code to have that list.

Alternatively, the code can use the tab10 colormap. For example, generate a list of colormaps using plt.cm.tab10. But since we can't import new modules, perhaps this isn't possible.

Another approach is to use the same cmap for all continuous columns. For example, 'viridis' for all. But the original code uses 'viridis' and 'plasma' for two continuous columns. So maybe it's acceptable to use 'viridis' for all.

But the user's code, according to the example given, had:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]  # Added colormap for the third plot

So, changing this to:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis"] * (len(results_df.columns) - 1)

This would ensure that there are enough cmaps for any number of columns. For four columns, cmaps would be ["coolwarm", "viridis", "viridis", "viridis"], which might not be ideal, but the code would run. However, the third and fourth columns would use the same cmap. But perhaps that's better than crashing.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should use a different cmap for each column, but the first. For example, for the first column: 'coolwarm', then cycle through 'viridis', 'plasma', 'cividis', etc.

But given that the user's code is part of a larger codebase, perhaps the correct approach is to generate a list of cmaps that is the same length as the number of columns. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis"]
cmaps = cmaps[:len(results_df.columns)]

But if there are four columns, then 'cividis' is included. If there are five, then the code would slice to four. Wait, no. So for len(results_df.columns) of 5, cmaps would be ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis"][:5], which is all four, but the last is 'cividis' and there's no fifth.

Hmm. So perhaps the code should generate a list of cmaps with as many elements as the number of columns. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"]
cmaps = cmaps[:len(results_df.columns)]

But if there are four columns, it would take the first four, which are 'coolwarm', 'viridis', 'plasma', 'cividis'. If there are five columns, it would take all five. If there are six, it would take up to six.

But this requires that the code has a list of cmaps that is long enough. If the number of columns is more than six, then the code would again have a problem. But the user's instruction was "4 or more columns", so perhaps four columns is the main case. So adding two more cmaps would suffice.

Therefore, modifying the code's cmaps line to:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"][:len(results_df.columns)]

This way, up to six columns can have different cmaps. For four columns, it would be the first four in the list.

But in the code, this line is written as:

    cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]  # Added colormap for the third plot

So changing this to:

    cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"][:len(results_df.columns)]

But wait, the code is written to have per-column cmaps. If len(results_df.columns) is 4, then the cmaps would be ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis"].

But in the code, the titles are generated for each column. So the first column is categorical/binary, and the rest are continuous.

Now, the code will have 4 cmaps if there are four columns. This would allow the code to work with four columns, each having their own cmap. The added cmaps are 'cividis', 'magma', and 'inferno' for the fourth, fifth, and sixth columns.

But this seems a bit arbitrary. But given the user's request to make the code work with 4 or more columns, this approach would.hopefully does that. The problem was that the code couldn't handle more than three, so adding more cmaps in a list that can be sliced to the number of columns.

So modifying the line:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]  # Added colormap for the third plot

to

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"][:len(results_df.columns)]

But this would slice to len(results_df.columns) elements. For example, if there are four columns, it would take the first four: 'coolwarm', 'viridis', 'plasma', 'cividis'. If there are five, it would take the first five, etc.

But the code may not have all these colormaps. For example, 'cividis' is a valid colormap, but ' inferno' is. So perhaps this is acceptable.

Another thing is to check if the code's line:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]  # Added colormap for the third plot

is part of the code. So the original code has this line. The user wants to modify this to handle more columns. Therefore, in the code, we need to extend the list.

So the modified line would be:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"]  # Added colormaps for more columns

But this would require enough cmaps. However, this only works if there are up to six columns. For more, it would fail. But perhaps the user's code is designed for up to four, and this is the fix.

But the user's instruction is "make it work with 4 or more columns" and the code highlighted. So the code is supposed to handle any number of columns. Therefore, the code needs to generate a cmap for each column. So the code should have a list of cmaps that can be extended dynamically.

But I think the main problem is that the code's original list of cmaps only has three elements. So for four columns, the code will crash. The fix is to create a list of cmaps with as many elements as the number of columns. But how?

Perhaps the code can repeat the colormaps. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis", "plasma"] * (len(results_df.columns) - 1)
But this is not correct, because ["viridis", "plasma"] multiplied by 2 is ["viridis", "plasma", "viridis", "plasma"], so adding "coolwarm" would give ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "viridis", "plasma"]. Then, slice to len(results_df.columns). For example, if there are four columns, cmaps would be ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "viridis"]. But this is not ideal. But it would at least have four cmaps.

This might be the easiest fix. So modifying the line:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]  # Added colormap for the third plot

to

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis", "plasma"] * (len(results_df.columns) - 1)

But when len(results_df.columns) is 4:

["viridis", "plasma"] is two elements. Multiplied by (4-1)=3 gives ["viridis", "plasma", "viridis", "plasma", "viridis", "plasma"], which is six elements. Adding "coolwarm" gives ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", ...], and slice to four? No, the code is:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis", "plasma"] * (len(results_df.columns) - 1)

So for four columns, len -1 is 3. ["viridis", "plasma"] *3 = ["viridis", "plasma", "viridis", "plasma", "viridis", "plasma"], which is six elements. Adding "coolwarm" gives a list of seven elements. But we only need four. Wait, no: ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis", "plasma"] *3.

Wait, "viridis", "plasma", "viridis", "plasma", "viridis", "plasma" is six elements. Adding "coolwarm" at the front gives seven elements. But we need four. So this approach is not correct.

Wait, the code should generate a list of cmaps with the same number of elements as the number of columns. So for four columns, len =4. So (4-1)=3, and we need three more after the first. So the code would be:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis", "plasma", "cividis"][:len(results_df.columns)-1]

But again, this is not dynamic.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me look for an example solution. The user's code example is:

    cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]  # Added colormap for the third plot

But this line is causing issues when there are four columns because it's only three elements. The code needs to generate more cmaps. The simplest way to ensure that there's a cmap for each column is to make the cmaps list as long as the number of columns. For the first column, 'coolwarm', and the rest 'viridis'.

But that would make the code:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"] + ["viridis"] * (len(results_df.columns) - 1)

This way, the code will have a cmap for each column. For four columns, this would be ['coolwarm', 'viridis', 'viridis', 'viridis'].

But this is not perfect, as the third and fourth columns would use 'viridis' instead of 'plasma' and others, but it would allow the code to run. However, the original code uses 'viridis' for the second column and 'plasma' for the third. So changing this would break that. Therefore, perhaps the code should use a list that includes those colormaps and cycle if needed.

But perhaps the user's code can be modified to check the number of columns and assign cmaps accordingly. But since we can't change the code's structure, perhaps the best approach is to add more cmaps to the list.

So modifying the line to:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"][:len(results_df.columns)]

This way, the code can handle up to six columns. For four columns, the code would have four cmaps. For more than that, it would slice and use up to the available cmaps, but that's not ideal. But the user's instruction is to make it work with 4 or more columns. So this might be acceptable.

But if the code has more than six columns, the list would slice to six, but the code would generate six subplots, which is a problem. However, the user's problem is handling four, so adding two more cmaps would solve that.

So the original code uses three cmaps. To handle four, we need to add a fourth. Let's choose 'cividis' and modify the code:

    cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis"]  # Added colormap for third and fourth

But this is now four elements, so if there are four columns, it would work. But if there's a fifth, it would fail. But the user's request is "4 or more", so this may not be sufficient. However, given the code's current structure, perhaps this is the best we can do. But the original code's line has cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"], so modifying it to include 'cividis' as the fourth element would allow four columns.

But in the code, the line is:

    cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma"]  # Added colormap for the third plot

So the fix would be to add more elements to this list. Let's change it to:

    cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"]  # Added more colormaps

But wait, the code uses zip(matrices, axes, titles, cmaps), which requires that cmaps has the same length as the other lists. So for four columns, the cmaps list must have four elements. By adding 'cividis', 'magma', 'inferno' to the list, the code can now handle up to six columns. So this would cover four columns.

But can we do this dynamically? For example, generate the cmaps list such that it's as long as the number of columns. But since the code is in a function that is part of the larger code, perhaps it's not possible. Therefore, the code must be modified to include more cmaps in the list.

So changing the line to:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"][:len(results_df.columns)]

This would take the first 'len' items. For four columns, it would be the first four. For three, it's the first three. For five, it's the first five (but the list only has six elements).

But what if the code has more than six columns? Then, the code would truncate to six. But perhaps the user's code is intended for up to four columns. So this fix would at least allow four.

But perhaps the code needs to dynamically generate cmaps for any number of columns. For example, using a loop. But the code as written uses a list. Therefore, the best approach is to adjust the cmaps list to include more elements.

Another possibility is to remove the slicing and just make the list as long as possible. But this is not dynamic.

I think the best solution here is to modify the cmaps list to include more elements, thus allowing the code to handle four or more columns. The user's code is designed to handle three, so adding two more would get to five. But perhaps four is sufficient. For example, modifying the cmaps line to:

    cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis"]  # Added colormap for third and fourth

But this would only handle four columns. For five, it would again fail. Therefore, perhaps the better approach is to make the cmaps list as long as the number of columns. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"]
cmaps = cmaps[:len(results_df.columns)]

But this requires the code to have a list that's long enough. If there are seven columns, the code would slice to six. So this may not be sufficient, but it's a step forward.

But given that the user's code example includes three cmaps and the problem is with four columns, adding two more to make five would allow four. But even better would be to generate the cmaps using a loop. However, the code as written uses a list. So maybe this is the only way.

Therefore, the code should be modified to:

    # Visualization setup
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(results_df.columns), figsize=(12, 2))
    titles = [f"{results_df.columns[i]} (Categorical/Binary)" if i == 0 else f"{results_df.columns[i]} (Continuous)" for i in range(len(results_df.columns))]
    cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"][:len(results_df.columns)]  # Added more colormaps
    # Plot each matrix
    for i, (matrix, ax, title, cmap) in enumerate(zip(matrices, axes, titles, cmaps)):
        im = ax.imshow(matrix, cmap=cmap, interpolation="none")
        ax.set_title(title)
        ax.set_xticks(range(grid_size))
        ax.set_yticks(range(grid_size))
        fig.colorbar(im, ax=ax)

This way, if there are four columns, cmaps will be ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis"], which is four elements. This allows the code to handle four columns.

Another possible adjustment is to check how many columns there are and generate cmaps accordingly. For example:

cmaps = ["coolwarm"]
if len(results_df.columns) > 1:
    cmaps += ["viridis"]
if len(results_df.columns) > 2:
    cmaps += ["plasma"]
if len(results_df.columns) > 3:
    cmaps += ["cividis"]
# Add more as needed

But this is not scalable. So perhaps the code is modified to have a list of cmaps that's long enough. For example:

    cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno", "turbo", "gnuplot2"][:len(results_df.columns)]

But this is just an example. The main point is to have a list of cmaps that can be sliced to the length of the columns.

In conclusion, the main issue was that the code's cmaps list had only three elements. The solution is to extend that list to include more cmaps, so that when sliced to the number of columns, there are enough entries.

To handle 4 or more columns properly, we need to ensure the colormap list (`cmaps`) matches the number of columns. The original code had statically defined colormaps only for up to 3 columns. 

Here's the updated code with dynamic colormap handling:
python
def visualize_results_grid(results_df):
    columns = [results_df.iloc[:, i] for i in range(len(results_df.columns))]
    columns = [pd.to_numeric(col, errors='coerce') if not pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(col) else col for col in columns]
    
    # Deduce the grid shape from the number of results rows
    grid_size = int(np.sqrt(len(results_df)))
    # Reshape columns into matrices
    matrices = [col.to_numpy().reshape(grid_size, grid_size) for col in columns]
    
    # Visualization setup
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(results_df.columns), figsize=(12, 2))
    titles = [f"{results_df.columns[i]} (Categorical/Binary)" if i == 0 else f"{results_df.columns[i]} (Continuous)" for i in range(len(results_df.columns))]
    cmaps = ["coolwarm", "viridis", "plasma", "cividis", "magma", "inferno"][:len(results_df.columns)]  # Added more colormaps to support more columns
    # Plot each matrix
    for i, (matrix, ax, title, cmap) in enumerate(zip(matrices, axes, titles, cmaps)):
        im = ax.imshow(matrix, cmap=cmap, interpolation="none")
        ax.set_title(title)
        ax.set_xticks(range(grid_size))
        ax.set_yticks(range(grid_size))
        fig.colorbar(im, ax=ax)

    # Display the plot
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

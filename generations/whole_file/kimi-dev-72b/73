This change adds SCP object-specific logic to generate possible actions using the same LLM-based approach as the D-class personnel. The SCP's actions are generated based on:

1. SCP's description and triggers
2. Current SCP state
3. Current D-personnel state
4. Room state
5. Action history

The LLM is instructed to generate 3-5 possible actions that the SCP might take given this context. This enables dynamic SCP behavior based on the current experiment state.

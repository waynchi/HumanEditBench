◁think▷Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to generate a new implementation for the minimumRecolors function based on the given LeetCode problem. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to get k consecutive black blocks by recoloring white blocks to black.

First, I need to understand the problem. The input is a string of 'W's and 'B's, and an integer k. The task is to find a window of length k where the number of 'W's (which need to be changed to 'B's) is minimized. So, the minimum number of 'W's in any k-length substring would be the answer.

The original code provided has a placeholder in the function. The user instruction is to finish this function. The existing code has the function signature and a blank space. So I need to write the function body.

Looking at the examples: For the first example, "WBBWWBBWBW" with k=7. The best window is the first 7 characters: "WBBWWBB", which has 3 'W's. Recoloring them gives 7 consecutive 'B's, so the answer is 3. The second example already has a window of 2 'B's, so no changes are needed.

The approach here is to use a sliding window of size k. We'll iterate through each possible window of length k in the blocks string and count the number of 'W's in each window. The minimum count across all windows will be the answer.

Wait, but how to implement this efficiently. Since the length of blocks is up to 100, a brute-force approach would be acceptable here. Let's think about the steps:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the minimum number of 'W's found so far. Let's start with a high value, like k (since the maximum possible 'W's in a window is k).
2. Iterate over each possible starting position of the window. The number of windows is len(blocks) - k + 1.
3. For each window position, count the number of 'W's in that substring.
4. Update the minimum count if the current window's count is lower.
5. After checking all windows, the minimum count is the answer.

Alternatively, we can use a sliding window approach where we count the 'W's in the first window, then as we slide the window, we subtract the 'W' that's left behind and add the new 'W' that's included. This would reduce the number of operations.

But given that n is up to 100, even the naive approach would work. So for simplicity, let's iterate through each possible window and count 'W's each time.

So the code would look like:

def minimumRecolors(self, blocks: str, k: int) -> int:
    min_ops = k  # maximum possible is k (all W's)
    for i in range(len(blocks) - k + 1):
        window = blocks[i:i+k]
        count = window.count('W')
        min_ops = min(min_ops, count)
    return min_ops

Let me test this with the first example. The blocks are "WBBWWBBWBW" and k=7. The possible windows are:

- "WBBWWBB" (positions 0-6): W count is 3
- "BBWWBBW" (1-7): W count is 3
- "BWWBBWB" (2-8): W count is 3
- "WWBBWBW" (3-9): W count is 4

The minimum is 3, which matches the example. For the second example, blocks = "WBWBBBW", k=2. The windows are:

- "WB" (0-1): 1 W
- "BW" (1-2): 1 W
- "WB" (2-3): 1 W
- "BB" (3-4): 0 W
- "BB" (4-5): 0 W
- "BW" (5-6): 1 W

The minimum here is 0, so no operations needed. That's correct.

So the implementation would be the sliding window approach. Let me check the constraints again. n can be up to 100, and k up to n. So the loop runs O(n) times, and each window.count('W') is O(k), making the total time O(nk). For the maximum case of n=100 and k=100, that's 100*100=10,000 operations, which is acceptable for a small input size.

But perhaps there's a more efficient way using a sliding window where we track the count as we move, which would make it O(n). Let's see:

Initialize the count for the first window. Then, as we slide the window by one position each time, we check if the outgoing character (the one before the window) is 'W' (subtract from count) and if the incoming character (the new one added) is 'W' (add to count). That way, we avoid recounting each window.

This approach would reduce the time complexity to O(n), which is better even if n is small.

So here's how to implement that:

1. Initialize count as the number of 'W's in the first window (blocks[0:k]).
2. Set min_ops to this count.
3. For each window starting at i from 1 to len(blocks) - k:
   a. Update count by subtracting the previous window's first character (blocks[i-1]) if it's 'W', and adding the new character (blocks[i+k-1]) if it's 'W'.
   b. Update min_ops with the new count if it's lower.
4. Return min_ops.

This way, each step is O(1) after the initial O(k) for the first window. So total time is O(n + k), but since k is up to n, it's O(n).

But the code for this would be a bit more complex. Let's compare the two methods.

The initial approach (counting each window) is simpler to code, but for large k, it's less efficient. But given that k is up to 100, and n is up to 100, the first method is acceptable. However, using the sliding window approach is more efficient even for the given constraints.

So I'll implement the sliding window approach.

Here's the code:

def minimumRecolors(self, blocks: str, k: int) -> int:
    # First window count
    current = sum(1 for char in blocks[:k] if char == 'W')
    min_ops = current
    # Slide the window
    for i in range(k, len(blocks)):
        # Remove the left character
        if blocks[i - k] == 'W':
            current -= 1
        # Add the right character
        if blocks[i] == 'W':
            current += 1
        # Update min_ops
        if current < min_ops:
            min_ops = current
    return min_ops

Wait, let's check this with the first example. The blocks are "WBBWWBBWBW", k=7.

First window is "WBBWWBB" (indices 0-6). The 'W's are at 0, 3, 4. So count is 3. Then, for the next window:

i=7: blocks[7] is 'W' (since the full string is index 0: 'W', 1: 'B', ..., 9: 'W'.

Wait, let me write down the indices:

blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW" (length 10, indices 0-9)

First window (0-6): "WBBWWBB" → 3 'W's.

Next window starts at i=1 (since first window was 0-6, next is 1-7):

Wait, the loop starts at i=k. Wait, no. Let me see.

Wait, in the loop:

for i in range(k, len(blocks)):

Wait, k is 7 in the first example. len(blocks) is 10. So i goes from 7 to 9 (3 iterations? Wait, no. Let's see:

Wait, the first window is from 0 to k-1. Then, each iteration moves the window one position to the right. So the number of windows is len(blocks) - k + 1.

Wait, perhaps the sliding window loop is better handled by iterating over the start index of the window. Let me adjust the approach.

Wait, perhaps the code should be:

def minimumRecolors(self, blocks: str, k: int) -> int:
    current = 0
    # Calculate initial window
    for i in range(k):
        if blocks[i] == 'W':
            current += 1
    min_ops = current
    # Slide the window
    for i in range(1, len(blocks) - k + 1):
        # Remove the element exiting the window
        if blocks[i-1] == 'W':
            current -= 1
        # Add the new element entering the window
        if blocks[i + k -1] == 'W':
            current += 1
        # Update min_ops
        min_ops = min(min_ops, current)
    return min_ops

Wait, let me test this with the first example. For blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k=7.

Initial window (i=0 to 6):

blocks[0]: 'W' → current=1

blocks[1]: 'B' → current=1

blocks[2]: 'B' → current=1

blocks[3]: 'W' → current=2

blocks[4]: 'W' → current=3

blocks[5]: 'B' → current=3

blocks[6]: 'B' → current=3

So initial current is 3, min_ops = 3.

Now, loop starts at i=1 (since len(blocks) - k +1 is 10-7+1=4, so i runs 1,2,3).

First iteration (i=1):

Check if blocks[i-1] = blocks[0] is 'W' → yes → current -=1 → current=2.

Check if blocks[i +k -1] = blocks[1 +7 -1] = blocks[7] is 'W' → blocks[7] is 'W' → current +=1 → current=3.

min_ops remains 3.

Second iteration (i=2):

blocks[1] is 'B' → no change.

Check blocks[2 +7 -1] = blocks[8] is 'B' → no change. current remains 3, min_ops remains 3.

Third iteration (i=3):

blocks[2] is 'B' → no change.

Check blocks[3 +7 -1] = blocks[9] is 'W' → current +=1 → current=4.

min_ops remains 3.

So the function returns 3, which is correct.

Another test case: blocks = "WBWBBBW", k=2.

Initial window (i=0 to1):

blocks[0]: 'W' → current=1

blocks[1]: 'B' → current=1

min_ops=1.

Loop runs for i=1 (since len-7, len=7, k=2 → len -k +1=6 → i=1,2,3,4,5.

Wait, len(blocks)=7, k=2 → len -k +1 =7-2+1=6 → i from 1 to5.

Wait, the loop is for i in range(1, len(blocks) -k +1), but in Python, range(1,6) is 1,2,3,4,5.

First iteration (i=1):

Check blocks[0] → 'W' → current-=1 → 0.

Check blocks[1+2-1] = blocks[2] → 'W' → current +=1 → 1.

min_ops remains 1.

Second iteration (i=2):

blocks[1] is 'B' → no change.

blocks[3] is 'B' → no change. current=1, min_ops=1.

Third iteration (i=3):

blocks[2] is 'W' → current -=1 → 0.

blocks[4] is 'B' → no change. current=0, min_ops=0.

Fourth iteration (i=4):

blocks[3] is 'B' → no change.

blocks[5] is 'B' → no change. current=0, min_ops=0.

Fifth iteration (i=5):

blocks[4] is 'B' → no change.

blocks[6] is 'W' → current +=1 → 1.

min_ops remains 0.

So the function returns 0, which is correct.

So the sliding window approach works. Now, let's code this.

The code would be:

class Solution:
    def minimumRecolors(self, blocks: str, k: int) -> int:
        # Count 'W's in the first window
        current = sum(1 for char in blocks[:k] if char == 'W')
        min_ops = current
        # Slide the window from the second window to the end
        for i in range(1, len(blocks) - k + 1):
            # Remove the leftmost character of the previous window
            if blocks[i - 1] == 'W':
                current -= 1
            # Add the new rightmost character of the current window
            if blocks[i + k - 1] == 'W':
                current += 1
            # Update the minimum operations if needed
            if current < min_ops:
                min_ops = current
        return min_ops

Wait, the loop starts at i=1. For each i, the window is from i to i+k-1. So for i=0 to len(blocks) -k, the window is blocks[i:i+k].

But in the sliding approach, after the first window (i=0), we start at i=1.

So the code above seems correct. Let me check again.

Yes. The initial window is blocks[:k], which is from 0 to k-1. Then, each iteration moves the window one step to the right. For example, i=1, window is 1 to k. So the loop runs for i from 1 to (len(blocks) -k). But in the loop's for statement, it's range(1, len(blocks) - k +1), because the loop needs to run len(blocks) -k times.

Wait, len(blocks) is the entire length. For example, if blocks is length 10, k=7, then (len(blocks) -k +1) is 10-7+1=4, so i runs from 1 to3 (since range(1,4) is 1,2,3). So the loop runs three times after the initial window. That's correct because the windows are 0-6,1-7,2-8,3-9 (four windows in total). The initial window is the first one (i=0), then the loop runs from i=1 to3 (three more windows). But wait, the total number of windows is len(blocks) -k +1. For blocks=10, k=7 → 4 windows. The initial code counts the first window (i=0), then the loop runs for i=1 to3 (three iterations), but the loop should run len(blocks) -k times? No, wait:

The initial window is i=0. Then, the loop starts at i=1 and goes up to (len(blocks) -k). Wait, let's calculate:

For the first example:

len(blocks) =10, k=7 → len -k +1 =4 → so the loop runs for i=1,2,3. The first window is i=0, then three more, making four total.

But in the code, the loop is for i in range(1, len(blocks) -k +1). Wait, len(blocks) -k +1 is4, so range(1,4) → 1,2,3. So the loop runs three times. But there are four windows. Wait, no. Wait, the initial window is i=0. The loop starts at i=1 and goes up to (len(blocks) -k) ?

Wait, no. The code's loop is: for i in range(1, len(blocks) - k + 1). Let's re-express this.

Wait, let's denote total_windows = len(blocks) - k + 1. The initial window is processed, then we need to process the remaining total_windows -1 windows. So the loop should run from 1 to total_windows -1.

But range(1, total_windows) would generate 1 to total_windows-1. For example, if total_windows is4, then range(1,4) is1,2,3 → three iterations. But total_windows -1 is3. So the loop runs total_windows -1 times. But the total_windows is the number of windows, including the first one. So the loop runs total_windows -1 times. So the code is correct.

So the code is correct. Now, let's write it into the original code structure.

The original code has:

# @lc code=start
class Solution:
    def minimumRecolors(self, blocks: str, k: int) -> int:

        
# @lc code=end

We need to insert the implementation into the function.

So the final code is:

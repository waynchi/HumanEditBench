◁think▷Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to modify the code that finds numbers up to a limit which can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares. The original code has a function is_sum_of_four_squares that checks all possible combinations of a, b, c, d from 0 up to the square root of n. However, the issue here is that the current implementation allows zeros, but the user wants none of the squares to be zero. 

Wait, looking at the find_four_squares_sums function, after getting the result from is_sum_of_four_squares, it checks if a, b, c, d are all non-zero. But the problem is that the is_sum_of_four_squares function might return a combination where some of the variables are zero. For example, 1 can be written as 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2. The user wants to exclude such cases and only include numbers where all four squares are non-zero.

So the first thought is that the is_sum_of_four_squares function should be adjusted to not include zeros. But modifying that function might affect other parts. Alternatively, the find_four_squares_sums function is already checking for non-zero values, but maybe there's an error in the code structure.

Looking at the code for find_four_squares_sums, the loop runs from 1 to limit. For each n, it calls is_sum_of_four_squares(n). If the result is not None, it unpacks a, b, c, d and checks if all are non-zero. If so, it appends n to results. However, there's a problem here: the code as written has an 'if result' without being indented properly. Let me check the code again.

Original code for find_four_squares_sums:
def find_four_squares_sums(limit):
    ...
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        result = is_sum_of_four_squares(n)
if result:
    a, b, c, d = result
    if a != 0 and b != 0 and c != 0 and d != 0:
        results.append(n)
        return results

Wait, the 'if result:' is not indented under the loop. That's a syntax error. The code as written would have the 'if result' outside the loop, which is incorrect. So the user's code probably has an indentation error. But according to the problem statement, the user wants to modify the highlighted section. The highlighted code seems to have the 'if result' not properly indented. So the first correction is to fix the indentation.

But that's part of the code the user provided as needing change. So the correct code should have the 'if result:' inside the loop. Let me rewrite it correctly:

Inside find_four_squares_sums:
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        result = is_sum_of_four_squares(n)
        if result:
            a, b, c, d = result
            if a != 0 and b != 0 and c != 0 and d != 0:
                results.append(n)
    return results

Wait, but the original code had 'return results' inside the 'if a !=0 ...' block. That would make the function return after the first valid n. But the user probably wants to collect all such numbers up to the limit, not just the first one. So the 'return results' should be outside the loop. So the corrected code for find_four_squares_sums should be:

def find_four_squares_sums(limit):
    ...
    results = []
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        result = is_sum_of_four_squares(n)
        if result:
            a, b, c, d = result
            if a != 0 and b != 0 and c != 0 and d != 0:
                results.append(n)
    return results

So that's part of the fix. Then, in the example usage, the code loops through all numbers in sums_found and prints each. But the original code might have the 'return results' inside the conditional, causing early termination. So that's the first correction.

Another thing: the is_sum_of_four_squares function allows a, b, c, d to be zero. But the user's problem is that they want all four squares to be non-zero. So maybe the is_sum_of_four_squares function should be modified to only consider a, b, c, d >=1. That would make the function more efficient and directly return only valid combinations. However, the user's instruction says to change the highlighted section, which includes the find_four_squares_sums function and the example usage. So perhaps the fix is to adjust the is_sum_of_four_squares function's loops to start from 1 instead of 0. But the user might not want to change that function, as it's part of the original code. Wait, the user provided the code to be modified, and the highlighted section includes the is_sum_of_four_squares function as well? Let me check the highlighted code.

Looking back at the user's message, the highlighted code is the entire code block provided. Wait, no. The user says: "The user instruction is: Números que podem ser expressos como a soma de quatro quadrados não nulos: And they highlighted this section to be changed: [the code block]"

Wait, the user wants to modify the code so that the numbers found are those that can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares. The current is_sum_of_four_squares function allows zeros, but the find_four_squares_sums function checks for a, b, c, d being non-zero. However, the code structure is incorrect. So the fix involves two parts:

1. Correcting the indentation in find_four_squares_sums so that the 'if result' is inside the loop and properly appending all valid numbers, not returning early.
2. Modifying the is_sum_of_four_squares function to not include zeros, thus making the check in find_four_squares_sums unnecessary.

But the user's instruction says to change only the highlighted section. The highlighted section includes the entire code provided. Wait, the user's provided code includes the is_sum_of_four_squares function, the find_four_squares_sums function, and the example usage. So the user wants the helper (me) to generate a new implementation of this code where the sum of four squares has all non-zero terms.

So perhaps the solution is to modify the is_sum_of_four_squares function to iterate from 1 to sqrt(n) instead of 0 to sqrt(n). That way, all a, b, c, d are at least 1. Then, the check in find_four_squares_sums for a !=0 etc. would be unnecessary. But the user's code currently does that check, so maybe they need to adjust both functions.

Wait, let's think. The original is_sum_of_four_squares function checks all combinations of a, b, c, d from 0 to sqrt(n). But the user wants to exclude any combination where any of them is zero.

So modifying the loops to start from 1 instead of 0 would directly enforce that. Then, the is_sum_of_four_squares function would return a combination where all a, b, c, d are >=1. Then, the check in find_four_squares_sums would be unnecessary. But the user's code currently has that check. So perhaps the solution is to adjust the loops in is_sum_of_four_squares to start at 1, and remove the check in find_four_squares_sums. But the user's instruction says to change the highlighted section. Let me check the code again.

The user's original code for is_sum_of_four_squares has:

for a in range(int(n**0.5) + 1):
    for b in range(int(n**0.5) + 1):
        for c in range(int(n**0.5) + 1):
            for d in range(int(n**0.5) + 1):

Which includes zero. To exclude zero, change the range to start from 1:

for a in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
    for b in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        for c in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            for d in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):

But wait, if n is 1, then sqrt(n) is 1, so the range would be 1 to 2 (since range is up to but not including). But a^2 would be 1, 4, etc. But since we're looking for a sum of four squares equal to n, and each term is at least 1, then n must be at least 4. But the user's code checks up to the limit. However, if we adjust the loops to start at 1, then for n=1, there's no solution. But according to Lagrange's four-square theorem, every natural number can be represented as the sum of four integer squares, but allowing zeros. So if we restrict to non-zero squares, some numbers can't be represented. For example, 7 can't be written as the sum of four non-zero squares. But 7 = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 (but that's allowing zeros). Wait, no: if all terms are non-zero, then the minimum sum is 1^2 +1^2 +1^2 +1^2 =4. So numbers less than 4 can't be represented. But the user's code starts from 1. However, the problem here is that the user wants to find numbers that can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares. So modifying the is_sum_of_four_squares function's loops to start at 1 would ensure that only such combinations are considered. Then, the check in find_four_squares_sums would be unnecessary. So the code would become:

def is_sum_of_four_squares(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    for a in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        for b in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            for c in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
                for d in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
                    if a**2 + b**2 + c**2 + d**2 == n:
                        return a, b, c, d
    return None

def find_four_squares_sums(limit):
    """
    Finds numbers up to a limit that can be expressed as the sum of four squares
    without any of the squares being zero.
    """
    results = []
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        result = is_sum_of_four_squares(n)
        if result:
            results.append(n)
    return results

Then, the example usage would loop through all results and print them. But the original code in find_four_squares_sums had a check for a, b, c, d being non-zero. But if we modify the is_sum_of_four_squares function to only consider a, b, c, d >=1, then that check is redundant. So removing it would fix the code.

Additionally, in the find_four_squares_sums function, the original code had an indentation error. The 'if result:' was not indented under the loop. So correcting that and removing the check for a, b, c, d would be necessary.

So putting it all together:

The modified code would:

1. Change the loops in is_sum_of_four_squares to start at 1 instead of 0.
2. Fix the indentation in find_four_squares_sums and remove the a !=0 checks.

But wait, if the is_sum_of_four_squares function now returns only non-zero a, b, c, d, then the check in find_four_squares_sums is not needed. So the code for find_four_squares_sums can be simplified to:

def find_four_squares_sums(limit):
    results = []
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        result = is_sum_of_four_squares(n)
        if result:
            results.append(n)
    return results

That's correct.

Then, in the example usage, when looping through sums_found, it calls is_sum_of_four_squares again, which now returns non-zero a, b, c, d. So the print statement would be correct.

So the entire code would need these changes:

- is_sum_of_four_squares: loops start at 1.
- find_four_squares_sums: fix indentation and remove the a !=0 checks.

Additionally, in the example usage, the code loops through sums_found and calls is_sum_of_four_squares again. But since sums_found was generated using the modified function, it's redundant but not harmful. However, perhaps it's better to store the result once.

So the corrected code would be:

def is_sum_of_four_squares(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    for a in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        for b in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            for c in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
                for d in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
                    if a**2 + b**2 + c**2 + d**2 == n:
                        return a, b, c, d
    return None

def find_four_squares_sums(limit):
    """
    Finds numbers up to a limit that can be expressed as the sum of four squares
    without any of the squares being zero.
    """
    results = []
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        result = is_sum_of_four_squares(n)
        if result:
            results.append(n)
    return results

# Example usage:
limit = int(input("Digite o limite superior: "))
sums_found = find_four_squares_sums(limit)
print("Números que podem ser expressos como a soma de quatro quadrados não nulos:")
for num in sums_found:
    result = is_sum_of_four_squares(num)
    a, b, c, d = result
    print(f"{num} = {a}^2 + {b}^2 + {c}^2 + {d}^2")

But wait, in the example usage, for each num in sums_found, we call is_sum_of_four_squares again. But since we already found that num is in the results, we can store the a, b, c, d when we found it. But the current code in find_four_squares_sums only appends n, not the result. So when we loop through sums_found, we have to call is_sum_of_four_squares again. However, this is redundant and inefficient. But given the code structure, perhaps it's okay. However, in the original code, the user was doing that. So the code is correct.

But modifying the loops in is_sum_of_four_squares to start at 1 would ensure that all a, b, c, d are non-zero. Therefore, the check in the original find_four_squares_sums function (a !=0 etc) is no longer needed. So the code can be simplified by removing that check.

So the user's original code for find_four_squares_sums had:

    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        result = is_sum_of_four_squares(n)
if result:
    a, b, c, d = result
    if a != 0 and b != 0 and c != 0 and d != 0:
        results.append(n)
        return results

Which was incorrect due to indentation. The corrected code would look like:

    results = []
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        result = is_sum_of_four_squares(n)
        if result:
            a, b, c, d = result
            if a != 0 and b != 0 and c != 0 and d != 0:
                results.append(n)
    return results

But if we modify is_sum_of_four_squares to start loops at 1, then the a, b, c, d are all >=1, so the check a !=0 is redundant. Therefore, we can remove that check.

So the code becomes:

    results = []
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        result = is_sum_of_four_squares(n)
        if result:
            results.append(n)
    return results

Which is correct.

Therefore, the entire modified code would be:

def is_sum_of_four_squares(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    for a in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        for b in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            for c in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
                for d in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
                    if a**2 + b**2 + c**2 + d**2 == n:
                        return a, b, c, d
    return None

def find_four_squares_sums(limit):
    """
    Finds numbers up to a limit that can be expressed as the sum of four squares
    without any of the squares being zero.
    """
    results = []
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        result = is_sum_of_four_squares(n)
        if result:
            results.append(n)
    return results

# Example usage:
limit = int(input("Digite o limite superior: "))
sums_found = find_four_squares_sums(limit)
print("Números que podem ser expressos como a soma de quatro quadrados não nulos:")
for num in sums_found:
    result = is_sum_of_four_squares(num)
    a, b, c, d = result
    print(f"{num} = {a}^2 + {b}^2 + {c}^2 + {d}^2")

This way, the loops in is_sum_of_four_squares start at 1, ensuring all squares are non-zero. The find_four_squares_sums function collects all such numbers, and the example usage prints them. This should correctly find numbers that can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares.

But there's a small issue: for numbers that can be expressed in multiple ways, the function returns the first found combination. But that's acceptable for this problem.

So the final code is as above.

◁think▷Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to generate a new implementation of a code based on their instruction, which is about numbers that can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares. The original code provided is empty, but there's a highlighted section that needs to be changed. Wait, the original code is empty? Hmm, maybe the user is asking to create a new code from scratch using the given instruction.

The user instruction mentions "Números que podem ser expressos como a soma de quatro quadrados não nulos," which translates to numbers expressible as the sum of four non-zero squares. So the task is to write a Python program that finds such numbers.

First, I need to understand the mathematical problem. According to Lagrange's Four Square theorem, every natural number can be represented as the sum of four integer squares. But here, the squares are non-zero, so we're excluding zero. So the problem is to find numbers that can be written as a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 where a, b, c, d are all non-zero integers.

The user wants to generate a list of such numbers, maybe up to a certain limit. The original code is empty, so I need to create a new code block. The highlighted section is also empty, so perhaps the user is looking for a complete implementation.

Let me outline the steps for the code:

1. Determine a maximum value up to which numbers are to be checked. Maybe a variable like max_num.
2. Iterate through all combinations of a, b, c, d from 1 to sqrt(max_num), since squares can't be zero.
3. For each combination, calculate the sum of their squares.
4. Collect all unique sums that are less than or equal to max_num.
5. Sort and print the list.

Wait, but generating all combinations would be O(n^4), which could be slow for large max_num. Maybe there's a more efficient way. Alternatively, using nested loops for a, b, c, d up to sqrt(max_num), but that might be manageable for smaller ranges.

Alternatively, to optimize, once a^2 is determined, the remaining sum is max_num - a^2, and then check if that can be expressed as the sum of three squares. But that might complicate the code.

Alternatively, generate all possible sums of four squares within the range. For example, for a max_num of 100, loop through a, b, c, d from 1 to 10 (since 10^2 is 100), compute their squares' sum, and collect unique values.

But for a=1 to 10, b=1 to 10, etc., that's 10^4 = 10,000 combinations. Each combination gives a sum between 4 (1+1+1+1) and 400 (10+10+10+10 squared?), wait no: 10^2 is 100, so four 100s would be 400. So if max_num is 100, we can have a up to 10, but the sum could be up to 400. But if we set max_num as the upper limit, we need to ensure that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 <= max_num. So perhaps adjust the loops accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the code should:

- Set a maximum number, say 100.
- Iterate through all possible a, b, c, d from 1 to the square root of max_num.
- For each, compute the sum of squares.
- If the sum is <= max_num, add it to the list.
- Finally, sort and print the unique sums.

But in Python, to find the square root, perhaps using math.isqrt to get the integer square root.

Let me draft some code:

import math

max_num = 100
numbers = set()

for a in range(1, math.isqrt(max_num) + 1):
    for b in range(1, math.isqrt(max_num - a*a) + 1):
        for c in range(1, math.isqrt(max_num - a*a - b*b) + 1):
            d_sq = max_num - a*a - b*b - c*c
            if d_sq > 0:
                d = math.isqrt(d_sq)
                if d*d == d_sq:
                    numbers.add(a*a + b*b + c*c + d*d)

sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)

Wait, but this code is trying to find all numbers up to max_num that can be expressed as the sum of four squares. However, the loops for b and c are limited by the remaining sum. But maybe this approach is not correct, because for each a, the remaining sum is max_num - a*a, and then we need to split that into three squares. But the code as written is checking for d_sq to be a perfect square. That might not be correct. Because the sum of a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 doesn't require d to be an integer derived from the remaining sum. Wait, no. Wait, for each combination of a, b, c, we calculate d_sq as (max_num - a^2 - b^2 - c^2). Then we check if d_sq is a perfect square. If yes, then a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 equals max_num. But that's not the problem. The user wants to find numbers that can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares, not necessarily equal to max_num. So perhaps the original approach of generating all possible sums up to max_num is better.

Alternatively, the original code might have been a function to check if a number can be expressed as such, but the user wants to generate a list up to a certain limit.

Wait, the user's instruction is to generate a new implementation based on the given problem. The highlighted section is empty, so maybe the user expects to write the entire code.

Another approach: For each number from 4 (since the smallest sum is 1^2 *4 =4) up to max_num, check if it can be expressed as a sum of four non-zero squares.

To check that, perhaps iterate through all possible a, b, c, d such that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = n. If such a, b, c, d exist, then n is valid.

But again, this would require checking for each n, which could be time-consuming.

Alternatively, generate all possible sums of four squares and collect those within the range.

So the code can be:

import math

max_num = 100
result = set()

# a, b, c, d are from 1 to sqrt(max_num)
max_a = math.isqrt(max_num)
for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
    a_sq = a * a
    # if a_sq already exceeds max_num, break
    if a_sq > max_num:
        break
    for b in range(1, max_a + 1):
        b_sq = b * b
        sum_ab = a_sq + b_sq
        if sum_ab > max_num:
            break
        for c in range(1, max_a + 1):
            c_sq = c * c
            sum_abc = sum_ab + c_sq
            if sum_abc > max_num:
                break
            for d in range(1, max_a + 1):
                d_sq = d * d
                sum_total = sum_abc + d_sq
                if sum_total > max_num:
                    break
                result.add(sum_total)

print(sorted(result))

But nested loops can be expensive. For max_num=100, max_a is 10, so 10^4=10,000 iterations. It's manageable. But when sum_total exceeds max_num, breaking may save some time.

Alternatively, generate all combinations and collect unique sums. Then sort them.

Wait, but this code would generate all possible sums of four squares where each term is at least 1^2=1, so the smallest sum is 4. The largest possible sum with max_a=10 would be 4*100=400. But if max_num is 100, the code would skip sums over 100.

Wait, in the code above, for each a, b, c, d, sum_total is a_sq + b_sq + c_sq + d_sq. If that sum_total is <=max_num, add it to result.

So for example, if max_num is 100, then the code would generate all sums up to 100. But perhaps the code can be optimized further.

But given that the user's example code is empty, and the instruction is to generate the new code for the problem, the code block would look something like this.

So the final code would be:
python
import math

def generate_numbers(max_num):
    result = set()
    max_sq = math.isqrt(max_num)
    for a in range(1, max_sq + 1):
        a_sq = a * a
        for b in range(1, max_sq + 1):
            b_sq = b * b
            sum_ab = a_sq + b_sq
            if sum_ab > max_num:
                continue
            for c in range(1, max_sq + 1):
                c_sq = c * c
                sum_abc = sum_ab + c_sq
                if sum_abc > max_num:
                    continue
                for d in range(1, max_sq + 1):
                    d_sq = d * d
                    total = sum_abc + d_sq
                    if total <= max_num:
                        result.add(total)
    return sorted(result)

print(generate_numbers(100))

But this code might miss some numbers. Or maybe not. Let's see. For example, when a, b, c, d are all 1, sum is 4. When a=10, each square is 100, sum is 400, but if max_num is 100, it's skipped. So setting max_sq as isqrt(max_num) would limit a, b, c, d to up to sqrt(max_num). Wait, no. Because d could be up to sqrt(max_num - sum_abc). But in the code, d is looped up to max_sq, which is sqrt(max_num). But sum_abc could be less than max_num, so d could be up to sqrt(max_num - sum_abc). But the code as written loops d from 1 to max_sq. So for example, if sum_abc is 50, and max_num is 100, then d could be up to sqrt(50), which is about 7. But the loop runs d up to max_sq (10). But in the code, after calculating total = sum_abc + d_sq, there's a check if total <= max_num. So if d_sq is too large, it's skipped.

So the code is correct. But perhaps to optimize, the inner loops could break once the sum exceeds max_num.

Wait, in the current code, for each a, b, c, d, the code computes total, and if it's <=max_num, adds it. So even if d is larger than necessary, but the total is still within max_num, it's added. But perhaps the loops could break early when the sum exceeds.

But for example, if a is 10, then a_sq is 100. The max_num is 100. Then sum_ab would be 100 + b_sq. If b is 1, then sum_ab is 101, which is over. But the code proceeds. But since the code checks if sum_ab > max_num, and continues, but in the inner loops, perhaps there's room for optimization.

Alternatively, for each a, the maximum possible b is sqrt(max_num - a_sq). So loop b from 1 to that. Similarly for c and d.

But that would require calculating the upper limit dynamically.

But given time constraints, the initial code with nested loops and checking the total might suffice.

Alternatively, use itertools.product to generate all combinations. But that may not be more efficient.

Another approach: use four nested loops, but break early when the sum exceeds max_num. For example:

import math

def generate_numbers(max_num):
    result = set()
    max_sq = math.isqrt(max_num)
    for a in range(1, max_sq + 1):
        a_sq = a * a
        for b in range(1, max_sq + 1):
            b_sq = b * b
            sum_ab = a_sq + b_sq
            if sum_ab > max_num:
                continue
            for c in range(1, max_sq + 1):
                c_sq = c * c
                sum_abc = sum_ab + c_sq
                if sum_abc > max_num:
                    continue
                for d in range(1, max_sq + 1):
                    d_sq = d * d
                    total = sum_abc + d_sq
                    if total <= max_num:
                        result.add(total)
                    else:
                        break  # since d is increasing, further d_sq will be larger
    return sorted(result)

print(generate_numbers(100))

But in Python, the break statement would exit the innermost loop. So once d_sq is too large, the loop for d can break. Similarly, for c and b, but that would require nested breaks. But in the current code, the break is only in the d loop. So when d_sq is too large, the loop breaks, and moves to the next c.

But maybe that's not necessary, since the code checks if total <= max_num, and adds only those. But including the break can save some iterations. However, since the code is adding all possible combinations, maybe the break is not necessary. But perhaps the code can be written to break early.

Alternatively, the code can be written as:

import math

def is_sum_of_four_squares(n):
    # Check if n can be expressed as sum of four non-zero squares
    for a in range(1, math.isqrt(n) + 1):
        a_sq = a * a
        for b in range(a, math.isqrt(n - a_sq) + 1):
            b_sq = b * b
            for c in range(b, math.isqrt(n - a_sq - b_sq) + 1):
                c_sq = c * c
                d_sq = n - a_sq - b_sq - c_sq
                if d_sq > 0 and math.isqrt(d_sq)**2 == d_sq:
                    return True
    return False

max_num = 100
print([n for n in range(4, max_num + 1) if is_sum_of_four_squares(n)])

But this code checks each n from 4 to max_num. For each n, it tries to find a, b, c, d such that their squares sum to n. The loops for b and c are limited by the remaining sum. But the code for d checks if the remaining is a perfect square.

But starting b from a and c from b may miss some combinations where a != b or c. Wait, but the code is checking for the existence of any combination. So for example, if a is 2, b is 1, that would be covered in another iteration where a is 1 and b is 2. But by limiting b to start from a, and c from b, we can avoid duplicates and make the code faster. But since the order of a, b, c, d doesn't matter, this approach would work.

But this code may be more efficient than the previous one because it directly checks for each number if it can be expressed as the sum.

But the user's original code is empty, so the new code needs to implement either approach.

But the user's instruction says to generate a new implementation based on the given code (which is empty) and change the highlighted section (also empty). So perhaps the user expects to write the entire code.

Given the time constraints, the initial code with nested loops and adding the sums to a set may suffice.

So the final code block would be:
python
import math

def generate_four_square_numbers(max_num):
    numbers = set()
    max_sqrt = math.isqrt(max_num)
    for a in range(1, max_sqrt + 1):
        a_sq = a * a
        for b in range(1, max_sqrt + 1):
            b_sq = b * b
            if a_sq + b_sq > max_num:
                continue
            for c in range(1, max_sqrt + 1):
                c_sq = c * c
                if a_sq + b_sq + c_sq > max_num:
                    continue
                for d in range(1, max_sqrt + 1):
                    d_sq = d * d
                    total = a_sq + b_sq + c_sq + d_sq
                    if total <= max_num:
                        numbers.add(total)
    return sorted(numbers)

print(generate_four_square_numbers(100))

This code loops through all possible combinations of a, b, c, d from 1 to sqrt(max_num), calculates their squares' sum, and adds it to the set if it's within the limit. Then returns the sorted list.

But in Python, math.isqrt is available in Python 3.8+. If older versions are a concern, but the user is likely using a modern Python version.

Alternatively, using integer square root calculation.

But the code should work. For example, when max_num is 100, the output would include numbers like 4 (1+1+1+1), 7 (1+1+1+4), etc.

But the user's problem is about numbers that can be expressed as the sum of four non-zero squares. So the code should include all numbers that can be expressed in that way.

But maybe the code can be optimized by using a helper function to check for each number. But given the time, the nested loop approach is acceptable.

So the final answer is the code block as above.

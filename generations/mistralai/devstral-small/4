Since the original code was empty, I'll create a complete Flask app that shows the current date and time. Here's the implementation:
python
from flask import Flask
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def show_datetime():
    current_datetime = datetime.now()
    return f"Current date and time: {current_datetime}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

This creates a simple Flask application that:
1. Imports the necessary modules (Flask and datetime)
2. Creates a Flask app instance
3. Defines a route ('/') that returns the current date and time
4. Runs the app in debug mode when executed directly

When you run this code and visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser, you'll see the current date and time displayed.

Since the original code was empty, I'll provide a complete implementation of a program that looks up an English dictionary and allows the user to search for words with a specific number of characters, then displays 10 such words.
python
import random

def load_dictionary(file_path='words_alpha.txt'):
    """Load words from a dictionary file"""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        words = [word.strip().lower() for word in file.readlines()]
    return words

def get_words_with_length(words, length):
    """Return words with the specified length"""
    return [word for word in words if len(word) == length]

def main():
    # Load the dictionary
    try:
        words = load_dictionary()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Dictionary file not found. Please ensure 'words_alpha.txt' exists in the same directory.")
        return

    print("Welcome to the Word Length Finder!")
    print("This program will find 10 words with the length you specify.")

    while True:
        try:
            length = int(input("Enter the number of characters you want (or 0 to quit): "))
            if length == 0:
                print("Goodbye!")
                break
            if length < 1 or length > 20:
                print("Please enter a number between 1 and 20.")
                continue

            matching_words = get_words_with_length(words, length)
            if not matching_words:
                print(f"No words found with {length} characters.")
                continue

            # Select 10 random words
            selected_words = random.sample(matching_words, min(10, len(matching_words)))
            print(f"\nHere are 10 words with {length} characters:")
            for i, word in enumerate(selected_words, 1):
                print(f"{i}. {word}")

        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This implementation:
1. Loads words from a dictionary file (default: 'words_alpha.txt')
2. Allows the user to specify a word length
3. Returns 10 random words of that length
4. Handles edge cases like invalid input or no matching words
5. Includes a clean exit option

The program will work with a standard English dictionary file in the same directory. You can find such files online (e.g., from the Unix dictionary or other word list sources).
